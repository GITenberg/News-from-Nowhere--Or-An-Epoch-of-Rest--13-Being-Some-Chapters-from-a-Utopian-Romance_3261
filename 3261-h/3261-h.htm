<h2>CHAPTER I: DISCUSSION AND BED</h2>
<p>Up at the League, says a friend, there had been one night a
brisk conversational discussion, as to what would happen on the
Morrow of the Revolution, finally shading off into a vigorous
statement by various friends of their views on the future of the
fully-developed new society.</p>
<p>Says our friend: Considering the subject, the discussion was
good-tempered; for those present being used to public meetings
and after-lecture debates, if they did not listen to each
others&rsquo; opinions (which could scarcely be expected of
them), at all events did not always attempt to speak all
together, as is the custom of people in ordinary polite society
when conversing on a subject which interests them.&nbsp; For the
rest, there were six persons present, and consequently six
sections of the party were represented, four of which had strong
but divergent Anarchist opinions.&nbsp; One of the sections, says
our friend, a man whom he knows very well indeed, sat almost
silent at the beginning of the discussion, but at last got drawn
into it, and finished by roaring out very loud, and damning all
the rest for fools; after which befel a period of noise, and then
a lull, during which the aforesaid section, having said
good-night very amicably, took his way home by himself to a
western suburb, using the means of travelling which civilisation
has forced upon us like a habit.&nbsp; As he sat in that
vapour-bath of hurried and discontented humanity, a carriage of
the underground railway, he, like others, stewed discontentedly,
while in self-reproachful mood he turned over the many excellent
and conclusive arguments which, though they lay at his
fingers&rsquo; ends, he had forgotten in the just past
discussion.&nbsp; But this frame of mind he was so used to, that
it didn&rsquo;t last him long, and after a brief discomfort,
caused by disgust with himself for having lost his temper (which
he was also well used to), he found himself musing on the
subject-matter of discussion, but still discontentedly and
unhappily.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I could but see a day of it,&rdquo; he
said to himself; &ldquo;if I could but see it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he formed the words, the train stopped at his station, five
minutes&rsquo; walk from his own house, which stood on the banks
of the Thames, a little way above an ugly suspension
bridge.&nbsp; He went out of the station, still discontented and
unhappy, muttering &ldquo;If I could but see it! if I could but
see it!&rdquo; but had not gone many steps towards the river
before (says our friend who tells the story) all that discontent
and trouble seemed to slip off him.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful night of early winter, the air just sharp
enough to be refreshing after the hot room and the stinking
railway carriage.&nbsp; The wind, which had lately turned a point
or two north of west, had blown the sky clear of all cloud save a
light fleck or two which went swiftly down the heavens.&nbsp;
There was a young moon halfway up the sky, and as the home-farer
caught sight of it, tangled in the branches of a tall old elm, he
could scarce bring to his mind the shabby London suburb where he
was, and he felt as if he were in a pleasant country
place&mdash;pleasanter, indeed, than the deep country was as he
had known it.</p>
<p>He came right down to the river-side, and lingered a little,
looking over the low wall to note the moonlit river, near upon
high water, go swirling and glittering up to Chiswick Eyot: as
for the ugly bridge below, he did not notice it or think of it,
except when for a moment (says our friend) it struck him that he
missed the row of lights down stream.&nbsp; Then he turned to his
house door and let himself in; and even as he shut the door to,
disappeared all remembrance of that brilliant logic and foresight
which had so illuminated the recent discussion; and of the
discussion itself there remained no trace, save a vague hope,
that was now become a pleasure, for days of peace and rest, and
cleanness and smiling goodwill.</p>
<p>In this mood he tumbled into bed, and fell asleep after his
wont, in two minutes&rsquo; time; but (contrary to his wont) woke
up again not long after in that curiously wide-awake condition
which sometimes surprises even good sleepers; a condition under
which we feel all our wits preternaturally sharpened, while all
the miserable muddles we have ever got into, all the disgraces
and losses of our lives, will insist on thrusting themselves
forward for the consideration of those sharpened wits.</p>
<p>In this state he lay (says our friend) till he had almost
begun to enjoy it: till the tale of his stupidities amused him,
and the entanglements before him, which he saw so clearly, began
to shape themselves into an amusing story for him.</p>
<p>He heard one o&rsquo;clock strike, then two and then three;
after which he fell asleep again.&nbsp; Our friend says that from
that sleep he awoke once more, and afterwards went through such
surprising adventures that he thinks that they should be told to
our comrades, and indeed the public in general, and therefore
proposes to tell them now.&nbsp; But, says he, I think it would
be better if I told them in the first person, as if it were
myself who had gone through them; which, indeed, will be the
easier and more natural to me, since I understand the feelings
and desires of the comrade of whom I am telling better than any
one else in the world does.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II: A MORNING BATH</h2>
<p>Well, I awoke, and found that I had kicked my bedclothes off;
and no wonder, for it was hot and the sun shining brightly.&nbsp;
I jumped up and washed and hurried on my clothes, but in a hazy
and half-awake condition, as if I had slept for a long, long
while, and could not shake off the weight of slumber.&nbsp; In
fact, I rather took it for granted that I was at home in my own
room than saw that it was so.</p>
<p>When I was dressed, I felt the place so hot that I made haste
to get out of the room and out of the house; and my first feeling
was a delicious relief caused by the fresh air and pleasant
breeze; my second, as I began to gather my wits together, mere
measureless wonder: for it was winter when I went to bed the last
night, and now, by witness of the river-side trees, it was
summer, a beautiful bright morning seemingly of early June.&nbsp;
However, there was still the Thames sparkling under the sun, and
near high water, as last night I had seen it gleaming under the
moon.</p>
<p>I had by no means shaken off the feeling of oppression, and
wherever I might have been should scarce have been quite
conscious of the place; so it was no wonder that I felt rather
puzzled in despite of the familiar face of the Thames.&nbsp;
Withal I felt dizzy and queer; and remembering that people often
got a boat and had a swim in mid-stream, I thought I would do no
less.&nbsp; It seems very early, quoth I to myself, but I daresay
I shall find someone at Biffin&rsquo;s to take me.&nbsp; However,
I didn&rsquo;t get as far as Biffin&rsquo;s, or even turn to my
left thitherward, because just then I began to see that there was
a landing-stage right before me in front of my house: in fact, on
the place where my next-door neighbour had rigged one up, though
somehow it didn&rsquo;t look like that either.&nbsp; Down I went
on to it, and sure enough among the empty boats moored to it lay
a man on his sculls in a solid-looking tub of a boat clearly
meant for bathers.&nbsp; He nodded to me, and bade me
good-morning as if he expected me, so I jumped in without any
words, and he paddled away quietly as I peeled for my swim.&nbsp;
As we went, I looked down on the water, and couldn&rsquo;t help
saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How clear the water is this morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice
it.&nbsp; You know the flood-tide always thickens it a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have seen it pretty
muddy even at half-ebb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said nothing in answer, but seemed rather astonished; and
as he now lay just stemming the tide, and I had my clothes off, I
jumped in without more ado.&nbsp; Of course when I had my head
above water again I turned towards the tide, and my eyes
naturally sought for the bridge, and so utterly astonished was I
by what I saw, that I forgot to strike out, and went spluttering
under water again, and when I came up made straight for the boat;
for I felt that I must ask some questions of my waterman, so
bewildering had been the half-sight I had seen from the face of
the river with the water hardly out of my eyes; though by this
time I was quit of the slumbrous and dizzy feeling, and was
wide-awake and clear-headed.</p>
<p>As I got in up the steps which he had lowered, and he held out
his hand to help me, we went drifting speedily up towards
Chiswick; but now he caught up the sculls and brought her head
round again, and said&mdash;&ldquo;A short swim, neighbour; but
perhaps you find the water cold this morning, after your
journey.&nbsp; Shall I put you ashore at once, or would you like
to go down to Putney before breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke in a way so unlike what I should have expected from a
Hammersmith waterman, that I stared at him, as I answered,
&ldquo;Please to hold her a little; I want to look about me a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no less
pretty in its way here than it is off Barn Elms; it&rsquo;s jolly
everywhere this time in the morning.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad you got
up early; it&rsquo;s barely five o&rsquo;clock yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I was astonished with my sight of the river banks, I was no
less astonished at my waterman, now that I had time to look at
him and see him with my head and eyes clear.</p>
<p>He was a handsome young fellow, with a peculiarly pleasant and
friendly look about his eyes,&mdash;an expression which was quite
new to me then, though I soon became familiar with it.&nbsp; For
the rest, he was dark-haired and berry-brown of skin, well-knit
and strong, and obviously used to exercising his muscles, but
with nothing rough or coarse about him, and clean as might
be.&nbsp; His dress was not like any modern work-a-day clothes I
had seen, but would have served very well as a costume for a
picture of fourteenth century life: it was of dark blue cloth,
simple enough, but of fine web, and without a stain on it.&nbsp;
He had a brown leather belt round his waist, and I noticed that
its clasp was of damascened steel beautifully wrought.&nbsp; In
short, he seemed to be like some specially manly and refined
young gentleman, playing waterman for a spree, and I concluded
that this was the case.</p>
<p>I felt that I must make some conversation; so I pointed to the
Surrey bank, where I noticed some light plank stages running down
the foreshore, with windlasses at the landward end of them, and
said, &ldquo;What are they doing with those things here?&nbsp; If
we were on the Tay, I should have said that they were for drawing
the salmon nets; but here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;of course that is
what they <i>are</i> for.&nbsp; Where there are salmon, there are
likely to be salmon-nets, Tay or Thames; but of course they are
not always in use; we don&rsquo;t want salmon <i>every</i> day of
the season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was going to say, &ldquo;But is this the Thames?&rdquo; but
held my peace in my wonder, and turned my bewildered eyes
eastward to look at the bridge again, and thence to the shores of
the London river; and surely there was enough to astonish
me.&nbsp; For though there was a bridge across the stream and
houses on its banks, how all was changed from last night!&nbsp;
The soap-works with their smoke-vomiting chimneys were gone; the
engineer&rsquo;s works gone; the lead-works gone; and no sound of
rivetting and hammering came down the west wind from
Thorneycroft&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Then the bridge!&nbsp; I had perhaps
dreamed of such a bridge, but never seen such an one out of an
illuminated manuscript; for not even the Ponte Vecchio at
Florence came anywhere near it.&nbsp; It was of stone arches,
splendidly solid, and as graceful as they were strong; high
enough also to let ordinary river traffic through easily.&nbsp;
Over the parapet showed quaint and fanciful little buildings,
which I supposed to be booths or shops, beset with painted and
gilded vanes and spirelets.&nbsp; The stone was a little
weathered, but showed no marks of the grimy sootiness which I was
used to on every London building more than a year old.&nbsp; In
short, to me a wonder of a bridge.</p>
<p>The sculler noted my eager astonished look, and said, as if in
answer to my thoughts&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it <i>is</i> a pretty bridge, isn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; Even the up-stream bridges, which are so much smaller,
are scarcely daintier, and the down-stream ones are scarcely more
dignified and stately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found myself saying, almost against my will, &ldquo;How old
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not very old,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it was built
or at least opened, in 2003.&nbsp; There used to be a rather
plain timber bridge before then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The date shut my mouth as if a key had been turned in a
padlock fixed to my lips; for I saw that something inexplicable
had happened, and that if I said much, I should be mixed up in a
game of cross questions and crooked answers.&nbsp; So I tried to
look unconcerned, and to glance in a matter-of-course way at the
banks of the river, though this is what I saw up to the bridge
and a little beyond; say as far as the site of the
soap-works.&nbsp; Both shores had a line of very pretty houses,
low and not large, standing back a little way from the river;
they were mostly built of red brick and roofed with tiles, and
looked, above all, comfortable, and as if they were, so to say,
alive, and sympathetic with the life of the dwellers in
them.&nbsp; There was a continuous garden in front of them, going
down to the water&rsquo;s edge, in which the flowers were now
blooming luxuriantly, and sending delicious waves of summer scent
over the eddying stream.&nbsp; Behind the houses, I could see
great trees rising, mostly planes, and looking down the water
there were the reaches towards Putney almost as if they were a
lake with a forest shore, so thick were the big trees; and I said
aloud, but as if to myself&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad that they have not built over Barn
Elms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I blushed for my fatuity as the words slipped out of my mouth,
and my companion looked at me with a half smile which I thought I
understood; so to hide my confusion I said, &ldquo;Please take me
ashore now: I want to get my breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded, and brought her head round with a sharp stroke, and
in a trice we were at the landing-stage again.&nbsp; He jumped
out and I followed him; and of course I was not surprised to see
him wait, as if for the inevitable after-piece that follows the
doing of a service to a fellow-citizen.&nbsp; So I put my hand
into my waistcoat-pocket, and said, &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
though still with the uncomfortable feeling that perhaps I was
offering money to a gentleman.</p>
<p>He looked puzzled, and said, &ldquo;How much?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t quite understand what you are asking about.&nbsp; Do
you mean the tide?&nbsp; If so, it is close on the turn
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I blushed, and said, stammering, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t
take it amiss if I ask you; I mean no offence: but what ought I
to pay you?&nbsp; You see I am a stranger, and don&rsquo;t know
your customs&mdash;or your coins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And therewith I took a handful of money out of my pocket, as
one does in a foreign country.&nbsp; And by the way, I saw that
the silver had oxydised, and was like a blackleaded stove in
colour.</p>
<p>He still seemed puzzled, but not at all offended; and he
looked at the coins with some curiosity.&nbsp; I thought, Well
after all, he <i>is</i> a waterman, and is considering what he
may venture to take.&nbsp; He seems such a nice fellow that
I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t grudge him a little
over-payment.&nbsp; I wonder, by the way, whether I
couldn&rsquo;t hire him as a guide for a day or two, since he is
so intelligent.</p>
<p>Therewith my new friend said thoughtfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what you mean.&nbsp; You think that I
have done you a service; so you feel yourself bound to give me
something which I am not to give to a neighbour, unless he has
done something special for me.&nbsp; I have heard of this kind of
thing; but pardon me for saying, that it seems to us a
troublesome and roundabout custom; and we don&rsquo;t know how to
manage it.&nbsp; And you see this ferrying and giving people
casts about the water is my <i>business</i>, which I would do for
anybody; so to take gifts in connection with it would look very
queer.&nbsp; Besides, if one person gave me something, then
another might, and another, and so on; and I hope you won&rsquo;t
think me rude if I say that I shouldn&rsquo;t know where to stow
away so many mementos of friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he laughed loud and merrily, as if the idea of being paid
for his work was a very funny joke.&nbsp; I confess I began to be
afraid that the man was mad, though he looked sane enough; and I
was rather glad to think that I was a good swimmer, since we were
so close to a deep swift stream.&nbsp; However, he went on by no
means like a madman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to your coins, they are curious, but not very old;
they seem to be all of the reign of Victoria; you might give them
to some scantily-furnished museum.&nbsp; Ours has enough of such
coins, besides a fair number of earlier ones, many of which are
beautiful, whereas these nineteenth century ones are so beastly
ugly, ain&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; We have a piece of Edward III.,
with the king in a ship, and little leopards and fleurs-de-lys
all along the gunwale, so delicately worked.&nbsp; You
see,&rdquo; he said, with something of a smirk, &ldquo;I am fond
of working in gold and fine metals; this buckle here is an early
piece of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No doubt I looked a little shy of him under the influence of
that doubt as to his sanity.&nbsp; So he broke off short, and
said in a kind voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I see that I am boring you, and I ask your
pardon.&nbsp; For, not to mince matters, I can tell that you
<i>are</i> a stranger, and must come from a place very unlike
England.&nbsp; But also it is clear that it won&rsquo;t do to
overdose you with information about this place, and that you had
best suck it in little by little.&nbsp; Further, I should take it
as very kind in you if you would allow me to be the showman of
our new world to you, since you have stumbled on me first.&nbsp;
Though indeed it will be a mere kindness on your part, for almost
anybody would make as good a guide, and many much
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There certainly seemed no flavour in him of Colney Hatch; and
besides I thought I could easily shake him off if it turned out
that he really was mad; so I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very kind offer, but it is difficult for me to
accept it, unless&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; I was going to say, Unless
you will let me pay you properly; but fearing to stir up Colney
Hatch again, I changed the sentence into, &ldquo;I fear I shall
be taking you away from your work&mdash;or your
amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t trouble about
that, because it will give me an opportunity of doing a good turn
to a friend of mine, who wants to take my work here.&nbsp; He is
a weaver from Yorkshire, who has rather overdone himself between
his weaving and his mathematics, both indoor work, you see; and
being a great friend of mine, he naturally came to me to get him
some outdoor work.&nbsp; If you think you can put up with me,
pray take me as your guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added presently: &ldquo;It is true that I have promised to
go up-stream to some special friends of mine, for the
hay-harvest; but they won&rsquo;t be ready for us for more than a
week: and besides, you might go with me, you know, and see some
very nice people, besides making notes of our ways in
Oxfordshire.&nbsp; You could hardly do better if you want to see
the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt myself obliged to thank him, whatever might come of it;
and he added eagerly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, that&rsquo;s settled.&nbsp; I will give my
friend a call; he is living in the Guest House like you, and if he
isn&rsquo;t up yet, he ought to be this fine summer
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith he took a little silver bugle-horn from his girdle
and blew two or three sharp but agreeable notes on it; and
presently from the house which stood on the site of my old
dwelling (of which more hereafter) another young man came
sauntering towards us.&nbsp; He was not so well-looking or so
strongly made as my sculler friend, being sandy-haired, rather
pale, and not stout-built; but his face was not wanting in that
happy and friendly expression which I had noticed in his
friend.&nbsp; As he came up smiling towards us, I saw with
pleasure that I must give up the Colney Hatch theory as to the
waterman, for no two madmen ever behaved as they did before a
sane man.&nbsp; His dress also was of the same cut as the first
man&rsquo;s, though somewhat gayer, the surcoat being light green
with a golden spray embroidered on the breast, and his belt being
of filagree silver-work.</p>
<p>He gave me good-day very civilly, and greeting his friend
joyously, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dick, what is it this morning?&nbsp; Am I to have
my work, or rather your work?&nbsp; I dreamed last night that we
were off up the river fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Bob,&rdquo; said my sculler; &ldquo;you will
drop into my place, and if you find it too much, there is George
Brightling on the look out for a stroke of work, and he lives
close handy to you.&nbsp; But see, here is a stranger who is
willing to amuse me to-day by taking me as his guide about our
country-side, and you may imagine I don&rsquo;t want to lose the
opportunity; so you had better take to the boat at once.&nbsp;
But in any case I shouldn&rsquo;t have kept you out of it for
long, since I am due in the hay-fields in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newcomer rubbed his hands with glee, but turning to me,
said in a friendly voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neighbour, both you and friend Dick are lucky, and will
have a good time to-day, as indeed I shall too.&nbsp; But you had
better both come in with me at once and get something to eat,
lest you should forget your dinner in your amusement.&nbsp; I
suppose you came into the Guest House after I had gone to bed
last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded, not caring to enter into a long explanation which
would have led to nothing, and which in truth by this time I
should have begun to doubt myself.&nbsp; And we all three turned
toward the door of the Guest House.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III: THE GUEST HOUSE AND BREAKFAST THEREIN</h2>
<p>I lingered a little behind the others to have a stare at this
house, which, as I have told you, stood on the site of my old
dwelling.</p>
<p>It was a longish building with its gable ends turned away from
the road, and long traceried windows coming rather low down set
in the wall that faced us.&nbsp; It was very handsomely built of
red brick with a lead roof; and high up above the windows there
ran a frieze of figure subjects in baked clay, very well
executed, and designed with a force and directness which I had
never noticed in modern work before.&nbsp; The subjects I
recognised at once, and indeed was very particularly familiar
with them.</p>
<p>However, all this I took in in a minute; for we were presently
within doors, and standing in a hall with a floor of marble
mosaic and an open timber roof.&nbsp; There were no windows on
the side opposite to the river, but arches below leading into
chambers, one of which showed a glimpse of a garden beyond, and
above them a long space of wall gaily painted (in fresco, I
thought) with similar subjects to those of the frieze outside;
everything about the place was handsome and generously solid as
to material; and though it was not very large (somewhat smaller
than Crosby Hall perhaps), one felt in it that exhilarating sense
of space and freedom which satisfactory architecture always gives
to an unanxious man who is in the habit of using his eyes.</p>
<p>In this pleasant place, which of course I knew to be the hall
of the Guest House, three young women were flitting to and
fro.&nbsp; As they were the first of the sex I had seen on this
eventful morning, I naturally looked at them very attentively,
and found them at least as good as the gardens, the architecture,
and the male men.&nbsp; As to their dress, which of course I took
note of, I should say that they were decently veiled with
drapery, and not bundled up with millinery; that they were
clothed like women, not upholstered like armchairs, as most women
of our time are.&nbsp; In short, their dress was somewhat between
that of the ancient classical costume and the simpler forms of
the fourteenth century garments, though it was clearly not an
imitation of either: the materials were light and gay to suit the
season.&nbsp; As to the women themselves, it was pleasant indeed
to see them, they were so kind and happy-looking in expression of
face, so shapely and well-knit of body, and thoroughly
healthy-looking and strong.&nbsp; All were at least comely, and
one of them very handsome and regular of feature.&nbsp; They came
up to us at once merrily and without the least affectation of
shyness, and all three shook hands with me as if I were a friend
newly come back from a long journey: though I could not help
noticing that they looked askance at my garments; for I had on my
clothes of last night, and at the best was never a dressy
person.</p>
<p>A word or two from Robert the weaver, and they bustled about
on our behoof, and presently came and took us by the hands and
led us to a table in the pleasantest corner of the hall, where
our breakfast was spread for us; and, as we sat down, one of them
hurried out by the chambers aforesaid, and came back again in a
little while with a great bunch of roses, very different in size
and quality to what Hammersmith had been wont to grow, but very
like the produce of an old country garden.&nbsp; She hurried back
thence into the buttery, and came back once more with a
delicately made glass, into which she put the flowers and set
them down in the midst of our table.&nbsp; One of the others, who
had run off also, then came back with a big cabbage-leaf filled
with strawberries, some of them barely ripe, and said as she set
them on the table, &ldquo;There, now; I thought of that before I
got up this morning; but looking at the stranger here getting
into your boat, Dick, put it out of my head; so that I was not
before <i>all</i> the blackbirds: however, there are a few about
as good as you will get them anywhere in Hammersmith this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert patted her on the head in a friendly manner; and we
fell to on our breakfast, which was simple enough, but most
delicately cooked, and set on the table with much
daintiness.&nbsp; The bread was particularly good, and was of
several different kinds, from the big, rather close,
dark-coloured, sweet-tasting farmhouse loaf, which was most to my
liking, to the thin pipe-stems of wheaten crust, such as I have
eaten in Turin.</p>
<p>As I was putting the first mouthfuls into my mouth my eye
caught a carved and gilded inscription on the panelling, behind
what we should have called the High Table in an Oxford college
hall, and a familiar name in it forced me to read it
through.&nbsp; Thus it ran:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Guests and neighbours</i>, <i>on the
site of this Guest-hall once stood the lecture-room of the
Hammersmith Socialists</i>.&nbsp; <i>Drink a glass to the
memory</i>!&nbsp; <i>May 1962</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to tell you how I felt as I read these words,
and I suppose my face showed how much I was moved, for both my
friends looked curiously at me, and there was silence between us
for a little while.</p>
<p>Presently the weaver, who was scarcely so well mannered a man
as the ferryman, said to me rather awkwardly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guest, we don&rsquo;t know what to call you: is there
any indiscretion in asking you your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have some doubts about it
myself; so suppose you call me Guest, which is a family name, you
know, and add William to it if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick nodded kindly to me; but a shade of anxiousness passed
over the weaver&rsquo;s face, and he said&mdash;&ldquo;I hope you
don&rsquo;t mind my asking, but would you tell me where you come
from?&nbsp; I am curious about such things for good reasons,
literary reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was clearly kicking him underneath the table; but he was
not much abashed, and awaited my answer somewhat eagerly.&nbsp;
As for me, I was just going to blurt out
&ldquo;Hammersmith,&rdquo; when I bethought me what an
entanglement of cross purposes that would lead us into; so I took
time to invent a lie with circumstance, guarded by a little
truth, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I have been such a long time away from Europe
that things seem strange to me now; but I was born and bred on
the edge of Epping Forest; Walthamstow and Woodford, to
wit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty place, too,&rdquo; broke in Dick; &ldquo;a
very jolly place, now that the trees have had time to grow again
since the great clearing of houses in 1955.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quoth the irrepressible weaver: &ldquo;Dear neighbour, since
you knew the Forest some time ago, could you tell me what truth
there is in the rumour that in the nineteenth century the trees
were all pollards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was catching me on my arch&aelig;ological natural-history
side, and I fell into the trap without any thought of where and
when I was; so I began on it, while one of the girls, the
handsome one, who had been scattering little twigs of lavender
and other sweet-smelling herbs about the floor, came near to
listen, and stood behind me with her hand on my shoulder, in
which she held some of the plant that I used to call balm: its
strong sweet smell brought back to my mind my very early days in
the kitchen-garden at Woodford, and the large blue plums which
grew on the wall beyond the sweet-herb patch,&mdash;a connection
of memories which all boys will see at once.</p>
<p>I started off: &ldquo;When I was a boy, and for long after,
except for a piece about Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s Lodge, and for
the part about High Beech, the Forest was almost wholly made up
of pollard hornbeams mixed with holly thickets.&nbsp; But when
the Corporation of London took it over about twenty-five years
ago, the topping and lopping, which was a part of the old
commoners&rsquo; rights, came to an end, and the trees were let
to grow.&nbsp; But I have not seen the place now for many years,
except once, when we Leaguers went a pleasuring to High
Beech.&nbsp; I was very much shocked then to see how it was
built-over and altered; and the other day we heard that the
philistines were going to landscape-garden it.&nbsp; But what you
were saying about the building being stopped and the trees
growing is only too good news;&mdash;only you
know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that point I suddenly remembered Dick&rsquo;s date, and
stopped short rather confused.&nbsp; The eager weaver
didn&rsquo;t notice my confusion, but said hastily, as if he were
almost aware of his breach of good manners, &ldquo;But, I say,
how old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and the pretty girl both burst out laughing, as if
Robert&rsquo;s conduct were excusable on the grounds of
eccentricity; and Dick said amidst his laughter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold hard, Bob; this questioning of guests won&rsquo;t
do.&nbsp; Why, much learning is spoiling you.&nbsp; You remind me
of the radical cobblers in the silly old novels, who, according
to the authors, were prepared to trample down all good manners in
the pursuit of utilitarian knowledge.&nbsp; The fact is, I begin
to think that you have so muddled your head with mathematics, and
with grubbing into those idiotic old books about political
economy (he he!), that you scarcely know how to behave.&nbsp;
Really, it is about time for you to take to some open-air work,
so that you may clear away the cobwebs from your
brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weaver only laughed good-humouredly; and the girl went up
to him and patted his cheek and said laughingly, &ldquo;Poor
fellow! he was born so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for me, I was a little puzzled, but I laughed also, partly
for company&rsquo;s sake, and partly with pleasure at their
unanxious happiness and good temper; and before Robert could make
the excuse to me which he was getting ready, I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But neighbours&rdquo; (I had caught up that word),
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t in the least mind answering questions, when
I can do so: ask me as many as you please; it&rsquo;s fun for
me.&nbsp; I will tell you all about Epping Forest when I was a
boy, if you please; and as to my age, I&rsquo;m not a fine lady,
you know, so why shouldn&rsquo;t I tell you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m hard
on fifty-six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the recent lecture on good manners, the weaver
could not help giving a long &ldquo;whew&rdquo; of astonishment,
and the others were so amused by his <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>
that the merriment flitted all over their faces, though for
courtesy&rsquo;s sake they forbore actual laughter; while I
looked from one to the other in a puzzled manner, and at last
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, please, what is amiss: you know I want to
learn from you.&nbsp; And please laugh; only tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, they <i>did</i> laugh, and I joined them again, for the
above-stated reasons.&nbsp; But at last the pretty woman said
coaxingly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, he <i>is</i> rude, poor fellow! but you see
I may as well tell you what he is thinking about: he means that
you look rather old for your age.&nbsp; But surely there need be
no wonder in that, since you have been travelling; and clearly
from all you have been saying, in unsocial countries.&nbsp; It
has often been said, and no doubt truly, that one ages very
quickly if one lives amongst unhappy people.&nbsp; Also they say
that southern England is a good place for keeping good
looks.&rdquo;&nbsp; She blushed and said: &ldquo;How old am I, do
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;I have always been told
that a woman is as old as she looks, so without offence or
flattery, I should say that you were twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed merrily, and said, &ldquo;I am well served out for
fishing for compliments, since I have to tell you the truth, to
wit, that I am forty-two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared at her, and drew musical laughter from her again; but
I might well stare, for there was not a careful line on her face;
her skin was as smooth as ivory, her cheeks full and round, her
lips as red as the roses she had brought in; her beautiful arms,
which she had bared for her work, firm and well-knit from
shoulder to wrist.&nbsp; She blushed a little under my gaze,
though it was clear that she had taken me for a man of eighty; so
to pass it off I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, the old saw is proved right again, and I
ought not to have let you tempt me into asking you a rude
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed again, and said: &ldquo;Well, lads, old and young,
I must get to my work now.&nbsp; We shall be rather busy here
presently; and I want to clear it off soon, for I began to read a
pretty old book yesterday, and I want to get on with it this
morning: so good-bye for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waved a hand to us, and stepped lightly down the hall,
taking (as Scott says) at least part of the sun from our table as
she went.</p>
<p>When she was gone, Dick said &ldquo;Now guest, won&rsquo;t you
ask a question or two of our friend here?&nbsp; It is only fair
that you should have your turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very glad to answer them,&rdquo; said the
weaver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ask you any questions, sir,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;they will not be very severe; but since I hear that you
are a weaver, I should like to ask you something about that
craft, as I am&mdash;or was&mdash;interested in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall not be of much use
to you there, I&rsquo;m afraid.&nbsp; I only do the most
mechanical kind of weaving, and am in fact but a poor craftsman,
unlike Dick here.&nbsp; Then besides the weaving, I do a little
with machine printing and composing, though I am little use at
the finer kinds of printing; and moreover machine printing is
beginning to die out, along with the waning of the plague of
book-making, so I have had to turn to other things that I have a
taste for, and have taken to mathematics; and also I am writing a
sort of antiquarian book about the peaceable and private history,
so to say, of the end of the nineteenth century,&mdash;more for
the sake of giving a picture of the country before the fighting
began than for anything else.&nbsp; That was why I asked you
those questions about Epping Forest.&nbsp; You have rather
puzzled me, I confess, though your information was so
interesting.&nbsp; But later on, I hope, we may have some more
talk together, when our friend Dick isn&rsquo;t here.&nbsp; I
know he thinks me rather a grinder, and despises me for not being
very deft with my hands: that&rsquo;s the way nowadays.&nbsp;
From what I have read of the nineteenth century literature (and I
have read a good deal), it is clear to me that this is a kind of
revenge for the stupidity of that day, which despised everybody
who <i>could</i> use his hands.&nbsp; But Dick, old fellow, <i>Ne
quid nimis</i>!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t overdo it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;am I likely
to?&nbsp; Am I not the most tolerant man in the world?&nbsp; Am I
not quite contented so long as you don&rsquo;t make me learn
mathematics, or go into your new science of &aelig;sthetics, and
let me do a little practical &aelig;sthetics with my gold and
steel, and the blowpipe and the nice little hammer?&nbsp; But,
hillo! here comes another questioner for you, my poor
guest.&nbsp; I say, Bob, you must help me to defend him
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Boffin,&rdquo; he cried out, after a pause;
&ldquo;here we are, if you must have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked over my shoulder, and saw something flash and gleam
in the sunlight that lay across the hall; so I turned round, and
at my ease saw a splendid figure slowly sauntering over the
pavement; a man whose surcoat was embroidered most copiously as
well as elegantly, so that the sun flashed back from him as if he
had been clad in golden armour.&nbsp; The man himself was tall,
dark-haired, and exceedingly handsome, and though his face was no
less kindly in expression than that of the others, he moved with
that somewhat haughty mien which great beauty is apt to give to
both men and women.&nbsp; He came and sat down at our table with
a smiling face, stretching out his long legs and hanging his arm
over the chair in the slowly graceful way which tall and
well-built people may use without affectation.&nbsp; He was a man
in the prime of life, but looked as happy as a child who has just
got a new toy.&nbsp; He bowed gracefully to me and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see clearly that you are the guest, of whom Annie has
just told me, who have come from some distant country that does
not know of us, or our ways of life.&nbsp; So I daresay you would
not mind answering me a few questions; for you
see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Dick broke in: &ldquo;No, please, Boffin! let it alone
for the present.&nbsp; Of course you want the guest to be happy
and comfortable; and how can that be if he has to trouble himself
with answering all sorts of questions while he is still confused
with the new customs and people about him?&nbsp; No, no: I am
going to take him where he can ask questions himself, and have
them answered; that is, to my great-grandfather in Bloomsbury:
and I am sure you can&rsquo;t have anything to say against
that.&nbsp; So instead of bothering, you had much better go out
to James Allen&rsquo;s and get a carriage for me, as I shall
drive him up myself; and please tell Jim to let me have the old
grey, for I can drive a wherry much better than a carriage.&nbsp;
Jump up, old fellow, and don&rsquo;t be disappointed; our guest
will keep himself for you and your stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared at Dick; for I wondered at his speaking to such a
dignified-looking personage so familiarly, not to say curtly; for
I thought that this Mr. Boffin, in spite of his well-known name
out of Dickens, must be at the least a senator of these strange
people.&nbsp; However, he got up and said, &ldquo;All right, old
oar-wearer, whatever you like; this is not one of my busy days;
and though&rdquo; (with a condescending bow to me) &ldquo;my
pleasure of a talk with this learned guest is put off, I admit
that he ought to see your worthy kinsman as soon as
possible.&nbsp; Besides, perhaps he will be the better able to
answer <i>my</i> questions after his own have been
answered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And therewith he turned and swung himself out of the hall.</p>
<p>When he was well gone, I said: &ldquo;Is it wrong to ask what
Mr. Boffin is? whose name, by the way, reminds me of many
pleasant hours passed in reading Dickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as
it does us.&nbsp; I see you take the allusion.&nbsp; Of course
his real name is not Boffin, but Henry Johnson; we only call him
Boffin as a joke, partly because he is a dustman, and partly
because he will dress so showily, and get as much gold on him as
a baron of the Middle Ages.&nbsp; As why should he not if he
likes? only we are his special friends, you know, so of course we
jest with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I held my tongue for some time after that; but Dick went
on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a capital fellow, and you can&rsquo;t help liking
him; but he has a weakness: he will spend his time in writing
reactionary novels, and is very proud of getting the local colour
right, as he calls it; and as he thinks you come from some
forgotten corner of the earth, where people are unhappy, and
consequently interesting to a story-teller, he thinks he might
get some information out of you.&nbsp; O, he will be quite
straightforward with you, for that matter.&nbsp; Only for your
own comfort beware of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dick,&rdquo; said the weaver, doggedly, &ldquo;I
think his novels are very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;birds of a
feather flock together; mathematics and antiquarian novels stand
on much the same footing.&nbsp; But here he comes
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in effect the Golden Dustman hailed us from the hall-door;
so we all got up and went into the porch, before which, with a
strong grey horse in the shafts, stood a carriage ready for us
which I could not help noticing.&nbsp; It was light and handy,
but had none of that sickening vulgarity which I had known as
inseparable from the carriages of our time, especially the
&ldquo;elegant&rdquo; ones, but was as graceful and pleasant in
line as a Wessex waggon.&nbsp; We got in, Dick and I.&nbsp; The
girls, who had come into the porch to see us off, waved their
hands to us; the weaver nodded kindly; the dustman bowed as
gracefully as a troubadour; Dick shook the reins, and we were
off.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV: A MARKET BY THE WAY</h2>
<p>We turned away from the river at once, and were soon in the
main road that runs through Hammersmith.&nbsp; But I should have
had no guess as to where I was, if I had not started from the
waterside; for King Street was gone, and the highway ran through
wide sunny meadows and garden-like tillage.&nbsp; The Creek,
which we crossed at once, had been rescued from its culvert, and
as we went over its pretty bridge we saw its waters, yet swollen
by the tide, covered with gay boats of different sizes.&nbsp;
There were houses about, some on the road, some amongst the
fields with pleasant lanes leading down to them, and each
surrounded by a teeming garden.&nbsp; They were all pretty in
design, and as solid as might be, but countryfied in appearance,
like yeomen&rsquo;s dwellings; some of them of red brick like
those by the river, but more of timber and plaster, which were by
the necessity of their construction so like medi&aelig;val houses
of the same materials that I fairly felt as if I were alive in
the fourteenth century; a sensation helped out by the costume of
the people that we met or passed, in whose dress there was
nothing &ldquo;modern.&rdquo;&nbsp; Almost everybody was gaily
dressed, but especially the women, who were so well-looking, or
even so handsome, that I could scarcely refrain my tongue from
calling my companion&rsquo;s attention to the fact.&nbsp; Some
faces I saw that were thoughtful, and in these I noticed great
nobility of expression, but none that had a glimmer of
unhappiness, and the greater part (we came upon a good many
people) were frankly and openly joyous.</p>
<p>I thought I knew the Broadway by the lie of the roads that
still met there.&nbsp; On the north side of the road was a range
of buildings and courts, low, but very handsomely built and
ornamented, and in that way forming a great contrast to the
unpretentiousness of the houses round about; while above this
lower building rose the steep lead-covered roof and the
buttresses and higher part of the wall of a great hall, of a
splendid and exuberant style of architecture, of which one can
say little more than that it seemed to me to embrace the best
qualities of the Gothic of northern Europe with those of the
Saracenic and Byzantine, though there was no copying of any one
of these styles.&nbsp; On the other, the south side, of the road
was an octagonal building with a high roof, not unlike the
Baptistry at Florence in outline, except that it was surrounded
by a lean-to that clearly made an arcade or cloisters to it: it
also was most delicately ornamented.</p>
<p>This whole mass of architecture which we had come upon so
suddenly from amidst the pleasant fields was not only exquisitely
beautiful in itself, but it bore upon it the expression of such
generosity and abundance of life that I was exhilarated to a
pitch that I had never yet reached.&nbsp; I fairly chuckled for
pleasure.&nbsp; My friend seemed to understand it, and sat
looking on me with a pleased and affectionate interest.&nbsp; We
had pulled up amongst a crowd of carts, wherein sat handsome
healthy-looking people, men, women, and children very gaily
dressed, and which were clearly market carts, as they were full
of very tempting-looking country produce.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;I need not ask if this is a market, for I see
clearly that it is; but what market is it that it is so
splendid?&nbsp; And what is the glorious hall there, and what is
the building on the south side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is just our Hammersmith
market; and I am glad you like it so much, for we are really
proud of it.&nbsp; Of course the hall inside is our winter
Mote-House; for in summer we mostly meet in the fields down by
the river opposite Barn Elms.&nbsp; The building on our right
hand is our theatre: I hope you like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be a fool if I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>He blushed a little as he said: &ldquo;I am glad of that, too,
because I had a hand in it; I made the great doors, which are of
damascened bronze.&nbsp; We will look at them later in the day,
perhaps: but we ought to be getting on now.&nbsp; As to the
market, this is not one of our busy days; so we shall do better
with it another time, because you will see more
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thanked him, and said: &ldquo;Are these the regular country
people?&nbsp; What very pretty girls there are amongst
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I spoke, my eye caught the face of a beautiful woman, tall,
dark-haired, and white-skinned, dressed in a pretty light-green
dress in honour of the season and the hot day, who smiled kindly
on me, and more kindly still, I thought on Dick; so I stopped a
minute, but presently went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask because I do not see any of the country-looking
people I should have expected to see at a market&mdash;I mean
selling things there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what
kind of people you would expect to see; nor quite what you mean
by &lsquo;country&rsquo; people.&nbsp; These are the neighbours,
and that like they run in the Thames valley.&nbsp; There are
parts of these islands which are rougher and rainier than we are
here, and there people are rougher in their dress; and they
themselves are tougher and more hard-bitten than we are to look
at.&nbsp; But some people like their looks better than ours; they
say they have more character in them&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
word.&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s a matter of taste.&mdash;Anyhow, the
cross between us and them generally turns out well,&rdquo; added
he, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>I heard him, though my eyes were turned away from him, for
that pretty girl was just disappearing through the gate with her
big basket of early peas, and I felt that disappointed kind of
feeling which overtakes one when one has seen an interesting or
lovely face in the streets which one is never likely to see
again; and I was silent a little.&nbsp; At last I said:
&ldquo;What I mean is, that I haven&rsquo;t seen any poor people
about&mdash;not one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knit his brows, looked puzzled, and said: &ldquo;No,
naturally; if anybody is poorly, he is likely to be within doors,
or at best crawling about the garden: but I don&rsquo;t know of
any one sick at present.&nbsp; Why should you expect to see
poorly people on the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean sick
people.&nbsp; I mean poor people, you know; rough
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, smiling merrily, &ldquo;I really do
not know.&nbsp; The fact is, you must come along quick to my
great-grandfather, who will understand you better than I
do.&nbsp; Come on, Greylocks!&rdquo;&nbsp; Therewith he shook the
reins, and we jogged along merrily eastward.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V: CHILDREN ON THE ROAD</h2>
<p>Past the Broadway there were fewer houses on either
side.&nbsp; We presently crossed a pretty little brook that ran
across a piece of land dotted over with trees, and awhile after
came to another market and town-hall, as we should call it.&nbsp;
Although there was nothing familiar to me in its surroundings, I
knew pretty well where we were, and was not surprised when my
guide said briefly, &ldquo;Kensington Market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just after this we came into a short street of houses: or
rather, one long house on either side of the way, built of timber
and plaster, and with a pretty arcade over the footway before
it.</p>
<p>Quoth Dick: &ldquo;This is Kensington proper.&nbsp; People are
apt to gather here rather thick, for they like the romance of the
wood; and naturalists haunt it, too; for it is a wild spot even
here, what there is of it; for it does not go far to the south:
it goes from here northward and west right over Paddington and a
little way down Notting Hill: thence it runs north-east to
Primrose Hill, and so on; rather a narrow strip of it gets
through Kingsland to Stoke-Newington and Clapton, where it
spreads out along the heights above the Lea marshes; on the other
side of which, as you know, is Epping Forest holding out a hand
to it.&nbsp; This part we are just coming to is called Kensington
Gardens; though why &lsquo;gardens&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rather longed to say, &ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> know&rdquo;; but
there were so many things about me which I did <i>not</i> know,
in spite of his assumptions, that I thought it better to hold my
tongue.</p>
<p>The road plunged at once into a beautiful wood spreading out
on either side, but obviously much further on the north side,
where even the oaks and sweet chestnuts were of a good growth;
while the quicker-growing trees (amongst which I thought the
planes and sycamores too numerous) were very big and
fine-grown.</p>
<p>It was exceedingly pleasant in the dappled shadow, for the day
was growing as hot as need be, and the coolness and shade soothed
my excited mind into a condition of dreamy pleasure, so that I
felt as if I should like to go on for ever through that balmy
freshness.&nbsp; My companion seemed to share in my feelings, and
let the horse go slower and slower as he sat inhaling the green
forest scents, chief amongst which was the smell of the trodden
bracken near the wayside.</p>
<p>Romantic as this Kensington wood was, however, it was not
lonely.&nbsp; We came on many groups both coming and going, or
wandering in the edges of the wood.&nbsp; Amongst these were many
children from six or eight years old up to sixteen or
seventeen.&nbsp; They seemed to me to be especially fine
specimens of their race, and enjoying themselves to the utmost;
some of them were hanging about little tents pitched on the
greensward, and by some of these fires were burning, with pots
hanging over them gipsy fashion.&nbsp; Dick explained to me that
there were scattered houses in the forest, and indeed we caught a
glimpse of one or two.&nbsp; He said they were mostly quite
small, such as used to be called cottages when there were slaves
in the land, but they were pleasant enough and fitting for the
wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be pretty well stocked with children,&rdquo;
said I, pointing to the many youngsters about the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;these children do not all
come from the near houses, the woodland houses, but from the
country-side generally.&nbsp; They often make up parties, and
come to play in the woods for weeks together in summer-time,
living in tents, as you see.&nbsp; We rather encourage them to
it; they learn to do things for themselves, and get to notice the
wild creatures; and, you see, the less they stew inside houses
the better for them.&nbsp; Indeed, I must tell you that many
grown people will go to live in the forests through the summer;
though they for the most part go to the bigger ones, like
Windsor, or the Forest of Dean, or the northern wastes.&nbsp;
Apart from the other pleasures of it, it gives them a little
rough work, which I am sorry to say is getting somewhat scarce
for these last fifty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, and then said, &ldquo;I tell you all this,
because I see that if I talk I must be answering questions, which
you are thinking, even if you are not speaking them out; but my
kinsman will tell you more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw that I was likely to get out of my depth again, and so
merely for the sake of tiding over an awkwardness and to say
something, I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the youngsters here will be all the fresher for
school when the summer gets over and they have to go back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;School?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;yes, what do you mean by
that word?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see how it can have anything to do
with children.&nbsp; We talk, indeed, of a school of herring, and
a school of painting, and in the former sense we might talk of a
school of children&mdash;but otherwise,&rdquo; said he, laughing,
&ldquo;I must own myself beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hang it! thought I, I can&rsquo;t open my mouth without
digging up some new complexity.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t try to set
my friend right in his etymology; and I thought I had best say
nothing about the boy-farms which I had been used to call
schools, as I saw pretty clearly that they had disappeared; so I
said after a little fumbling, &ldquo;I was using the word in the
sense of a system of education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Education?&rdquo; said he, meditatively, &ldquo;I know
enough Latin to know that the word must come from <i>educere</i>,
to lead out; and I have heard it used; but I have never met
anybody who could give me a clear explanation of what it
means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may imagine how my new friends fell in my esteem when I
heard this frank avowal; and I said, rather contemptuously,
&ldquo;Well, education means a system of teaching young
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not old people also?&rdquo; said he with a twinkle
in his eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I can
assure you our children learn, whether they go through a
&lsquo;system of teaching&rsquo; or not.&nbsp; Why, you will not
find one of these children about here, boy or girl, who cannot
swim; and every one of them has been used to tumbling about the
little forest ponies&mdash;there&rsquo;s one of them now!&nbsp;
They all of them know how to cook; the bigger lads can mow; many
can thatch and do odd jobs at carpentering; or they know how to
keep shop.&nbsp; I can tell you they know plenty of
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but their mental education, the teaching of their
minds,&rdquo; said I, kindly translating my phrase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guest,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perhaps you have not
learned to do these things I have been speaking about; and if
that&rsquo;s the case, don&rsquo;t you run away with the idea
that it doesn&rsquo;t take some skill to do them, and
doesn&rsquo;t give plenty of work for one&rsquo;s mind: you would
change your opinion if you saw a Dorsetshire lad thatching, for
instance.&nbsp; But, however, I understand you to be speaking of
book-learning; and as to that, it is a simple affair.&nbsp; Most
children, seeing books lying about, manage to read by the time
they are four years old; though I am told it has not always been
so.&nbsp; As to writing, we do not encourage them to scrawl too
early (though scrawl a little they will), because it gets them
into a habit of ugly writing; and what&rsquo;s the use of a lot
of ugly writing being done, when rough printing can be done so
easily.&nbsp; You understand that handsome writing we like, and
many people will write their books out when they make them, or
get them written; I mean books of which only a few copies are
needed&mdash;poems, and such like, you know.&nbsp; However, I am
wandering from my lambs; but you must excuse me, for I am
interested in this matter of writing, being myself a
fair-writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;about the children; when
they know how to read and write, don&rsquo;t they learn something
else&mdash;languages, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;sometimes even before
they can read, they can talk French, which is the nearest
language talked on the other side of the water; and they soon get
to know German also, which is talked by a huge number of communes
and colleges on the mainland.&nbsp; These are the principal
languages we speak in these islands, along with English or Welsh,
or Irish, which is another form of Welsh; and children pick them
up very quickly, because their elders all know them; and besides
our guests from over sea often bring their children with them,
and the little ones get together, and rub their speech into one
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the older languages?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they mostly learn Latin
and Greek along with the modern ones, when they do anything more
than merely pick up the latter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And history?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;how do you teach
history?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when a person can read, of
course he reads what he likes to; and he can easily get someone
to tell him what are the best books to read on such or such a
subject, or to explain what he doesn&rsquo;t understand in the
books when he is reading them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what else do they
learn?&nbsp; I suppose they don&rsquo;t all learn
history?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;some don&rsquo;t care
about it; in fact, I don&rsquo;t think many do.&nbsp; I have
heard my great-grandfather say that it is mostly in periods of
turmoil and strife and confusion that people care much about
history; and you know,&rdquo; said my friend, with an amiable
smile, &ldquo;we are not like that now.&nbsp; No; many people
study facts about the make of things and the matters of cause and
effect, so that knowledge increases on us, if that be good; and
some, as you heard about friend Bob yonder, will spend time over
mathematics.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis no use forcing people&rsquo;s
tastes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean that children learn
all these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;That depends on what you mean by children; and
also you must remember how much they differ.&nbsp; As a rule,
they don&rsquo;t do much reading, except for a few story-books,
till they are about fifteen years old; we don&rsquo;t encourage
early bookishness: though you will find some children who
<i>will</i> take to books very early; which perhaps is not good
for them; but it&rsquo;s no use thwarting them; and very often it
doesn&rsquo;t last long with them, and they find their level
before they are twenty years old.&nbsp; You see, children are
mostly given to imitating their elders, and when they see most
people about them engaged in genuinely amusing work, like
house-building and street-paving, and gardening, and the like,
that is what they want to be doing; so I don&rsquo;t think we
need fear having too many book-learned men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could I say?&nbsp; I sat and held my peace, for fear of
fresh entanglements.&nbsp; Besides, I was using my eyes with all
my might, wondering as the old horse jogged on, when I should
come into London proper, and what it would be like now.</p>
<p>But my companion couldn&rsquo;t let his subject quite drop,
and went on meditatively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, I don&rsquo;t know that it does them much
harm, even if they do grow up book-students.&nbsp; Such people as
that, &rsquo;tis a great pleasure seeing them so happy over work
which is not much sought for.&nbsp; And besides, these students
are generally such pleasant people; so kind and sweet tempered;
so humble, and at the same time so anxious to teach everybody all
that they know.&nbsp; Really, I like those that I have met
prodigiously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to me such very queer talk that I was on the point
of asking him another question; when just as we came to the top
of a rising ground, down a long glade of the wood on my right I
caught sight of a stately building whose outline was familiar to
me, and I cried out, &ldquo;Westminster Abbey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;Westminster
Abbey&mdash;what there is left of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what have you done with it?&rdquo; quoth I in
terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have <i>we</i> done with it?&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;nothing much, save clean it.&nbsp; But you know the whole
outside was spoiled centuries ago: as to the inside, that remains
in its beauty after the great clearance, which took place over a
hundred years ago, of the beastly monuments to fools and knaves,
which once blocked it up, as great-grandfather says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went on a little further, and I looked to the right again,
and said, in rather a doubtful tone of voice, &ldquo;Why, there
are the Houses of Parliament!&nbsp; Do you still use
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He burst out laughing, and was some time before he could
control himself; then he clapped me on the back and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take you, neighbour; you may well wonder at our
keeping them standing, and I know something about that, and my
old kinsman has given me books to read about the strange game
that they played there.&nbsp; Use them!&nbsp; Well, yes, they are
used for a sort of subsidiary market, and a storage place for
manure, and they are handy for that, being on the
waterside.&nbsp; I believe it was intended to pull them down
quite at the beginning of our days; but there was, I am told, a
queer antiquarian society, which had done some service in past
times, and which straightway set up its pipe against their
destruction, as it has done with many other buildings, which most
people looked upon as worthless, and public nuisances; and it was
so energetic, and had such good reasons to give, that it
generally gained its point; and I must say that when all is said
I am glad of it: because you know at the worst these silly old
buildings serve as a kind of foil to the beautiful ones which we
build now.&nbsp; You will see several others in these parts; the
place my great-grandfather lives in, for instance, and a big
building called St. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And you see, in this
matter we need not grudge a few poorish buildings standing,
because we can always build elsewhere; nor need we be anxious as
to the breeding of pleasant work in such matters, for there is
always room for more and more work in a new building, even
without making it pretentious.&nbsp; For instance, elbow-room
<i>within</i> doors is to me so delightful that if I were driven
to it I would most sacrifice outdoor space to it.&nbsp; Then, of
course, there is the ornament, which, as we must all allow, may
easily be overdone in mere living houses, but can hardly be in
mote-halls and markets, and so forth.&nbsp; I must tell you,
though, that my great-grandfather sometimes tells me I am a
little cracked on this subject of fine building; and indeed I
<i>do</i> think that the energies of mankind are chiefly of use
to them for such work; for in that direction I can see no end to
the work, while in many others a limit does seem
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI: A LITTLE SHOPPING</h2>
<p>As he spoke, we came suddenly out of the woodland into a short
street of handsomely built houses, which my companion named to me
at once as Piccadilly: the lower part of these I should have
called shops, if it had not been that, as far as I could see, the
people were ignorant of the arts of buying and selling.&nbsp;
Wares were displayed in their finely designed fronts, as if to
tempt people in, and people stood and looked at them, or went in
and came out with parcels under their arms, just like the real
thing.&nbsp; On each side of the street ran an elegant arcade to
protect foot-passengers, as in some of the old Italian
cities.&nbsp; About halfway down, a huge building of the kind I
was now prepared to expect told me that this also was a centre of
some kind, and had its special public buildings.</p>
<p>Said Dick: &ldquo;Here, you see, is another market on a
different plan from most others: the upper stories of these
houses are used for guest-houses; for people from all about the
country are apt to drift up hither from time to time, as folk are
very thick upon the ground, which you will see evidence of
presently, and there are people who are fond of crowds, though I
can&rsquo;t say that I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help smiling to see how long a tradition
would last.&nbsp; Here was the ghost of London still asserting
itself as a centre,&mdash;an intellectual centre, for aught I
knew.&nbsp; However, I said nothing, except that I asked him to
drive very slowly, as the things in the booths looked exceedingly
pretty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is a very good market
for pretty things, and is mostly kept for the handsomer goods, as
the Houses-of-Parliament market, where they set out cabbages and
turnips and such like things, along with beer and the rougher
kind of wine, is so near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he looked at me curiously, and said, &ldquo;Perhaps you
would like to do a little shopping, as &rsquo;tis
called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at what I could see of my rough blue duds, which I
had plenty of opportunity of contrasting with the gay attire of
the citizens we had come across; and I thought that if, as seemed
likely, I should presently be shown about as a curiosity for the
amusement of this most unbusinesslike people, I should like to
look a little less like a discharged ship&rsquo;s purser.&nbsp;
But in spite of all that had happened, my hand went down into my
pocket again, where to my dismay it met nothing metallic except
two rusty old keys, and I remembered that amidst our talk in the
guest-hall at Hammersmith I had taken the cash out of my pocket
to show to the pretty Annie, and had left it lying there.&nbsp;
My face fell fifty per cent., and Dick, beholding me, said rather
sharply&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hilloa, Guest! what&rsquo;s the matter now?&nbsp; Is it
a wasp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve left it
behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whatever you have left
behind, you can get in this market again, so don&rsquo;t trouble
yourself about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had come to my senses by this time, and remembering the
astounding customs of this country, had no mind for another
lecture on social economy and the Edwardian coinage; so I said
only&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My clothes&mdash;Couldn&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; You
see&mdash;What do think could be done about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t seem in the least inclined to laugh, but said
quite gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O don&rsquo;t get new clothes yet.&nbsp; You see, my
great-grandfather is an antiquarian, and he will want to see you
just as you are.&nbsp; And, you know, I mustn&rsquo;t preach to
you, but surely it wouldn&rsquo;t be right for you to take away
people&rsquo;s pleasure of studying your attire, by just going
and making yourself like everybody else.&nbsp; You feel that,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said he, earnestly.</p>
<p>I did <i>not</i> feel it my duty to set myself up for a
scarecrow amidst this beauty-loving people, but I saw I had got
across some ineradicable prejudice, and that it wouldn&rsquo;t do
to quarrel with my new friend.&nbsp; So I merely said, &ldquo;O
certainly, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, pleasantly, &ldquo;you may as
well see what the inside of these booths is like: think of
something you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;Could I get some tobacco and a pipe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what was I thinking
of, not asking you before?&nbsp; Well, Bob is always telling me
that we non-smokers are a selfish lot, and I&rsquo;m afraid he is
right.&nbsp; But come along; here is a place just
handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith he drew rein and jumped down, and I followed.&nbsp;
A very handsome woman, splendidly clad in figured silk, was
slowly passing by, looking into the windows as she went.&nbsp; To
her quoth Dick: &ldquo;Maiden, would you kindly hold our horse
while we go in for a little?&rdquo;&nbsp; She nodded to us with a
kind smile, and fell to patting the horse with her pretty
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a beautiful creature!&rdquo; said I to Dick as we
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, old Greylocks?&rdquo; said he, with a sly
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;Goldylocks,&mdash;the
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so she is,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a good job there are so many of them that every
Jack may have his Jill: else I fear that we should get fighting
for them.&nbsp; Indeed,&rdquo; said he, becoming very grave,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that it does not happen even now,
sometimes.&nbsp; For you know love is not a very reasonable
thing, and perversity and self-will are commoner than some of our
moralists think.&rdquo;&nbsp; He added, in a still more
sombre tone: &ldquo;Yes, only a month ago there was a mishap down
by us, that in the end cost the lives of two men and a woman,
and, as it were, put out the sunlight for us for a while.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t ask me about it just now; I may tell you about it
later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time we were within the shop or booth, which had a
counter, and shelves on the walls, all very neat, though without
any pretence of showiness, but otherwise not very different to
what I had been used to.&nbsp; Within were a couple of
children&mdash;a brown-skinned boy of about twelve, who sat
reading a book, and a pretty little girl of about a year older,
who was sitting also reading behind the counter; they were
obviously brother and sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, little neighbours,&rdquo; said
Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;My friend here wants tobacco and a pipe; can
you help him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, certainly,&rdquo; said the girl with a sort of
demure alertness which was somewhat amusing.&nbsp; The boy looked
up, and fell to staring at my outlandish attire, but presently
reddened and turned his head, as if he knew that he was not
behaving prettily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear neighbour,&rdquo; said the girl, with the most
solemn countenance of a child playing at keeping shop,
&ldquo;what tobacco is it you would like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Latakia,&rdquo; quoth I, feeling as if I were assisting
at a child&rsquo;s game, and wondering whether I should get
anything but make-believe.</p>
<p>But the girl took a dainty little basket from a shelf beside
her, went to a jar, and took out a lot of tobacco and put the
filled basket down on the counter before me, where I could both
smell and see that it was excellent Latakia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t weighed it,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and&mdash;and how much am I to take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I advise you to cram your
bag, because you may be going where you can&rsquo;t get
Latakia.&nbsp; Where is your bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fumbled about, and at last pulled out my piece of cotton
print which does duty with me for a tobacco pouch.&nbsp; But the
girl looked at it with some disdain, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear neighbour, I can give you something much better
than that cotton rag.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she tripped up the shop
and came back presently, and as she passed the boy whispered
something in his ear, and he nodded and got up and went
out.&nbsp; The girl held up in her finger and thumb a red morocco
bag, gaily embroidered, and said, &ldquo;There, I have chosen one
for you, and you are to have it: it is pretty, and will hold a
lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith she fell to cramming it with the tobacco, and laid
it down by me and said, &ldquo;Now for the pipe: that also you
must let me choose for you; there are three pretty ones just come
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She disappeared again, and came back with a big-bowled pipe in
her hand, carved out of some hard wood very elaborately, and
mounted in gold sprinkled with little gems.&nbsp; It was, in
short, as pretty and gay a toy as I had ever seen; something like
the best kind of Japanese work, but better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said I, when I set eyes on it,
&ldquo;this is altogether too grand for me, or for anybody but
the Emperor of the World.&nbsp; Besides, I shall lose it: I
always lose my pipes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child seemed rather dashed, and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you like it, neighbour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;of course I like
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, take it,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and
don&rsquo;t trouble about losing it.&nbsp; What will it matter if
you do?&nbsp; Somebody is sure to find it, and he will use it,
and you can get another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took it out of her hand to look at it, and while I did so,
forgot my caution, and said, &ldquo;But however am I to pay for
such a thing as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick laid his hand on my shoulder as I spoke, and turning I
met his eyes with a comical expression in them, which warned me
against another exhibition of extinct commercial morality; so I
reddened and held my tongue, while the girl simply looked at me
with the deepest gravity, as if I were a foreigner blundering in
my speech, for she clearly didn&rsquo;t understand me a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you so very much,&rdquo; I said at last,
effusively, as I put the pipe in my pocket, not without a qualm
of doubt as to whether I shouldn&rsquo;t find myself before a
magistrate presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you are so very welcome,&rdquo; said the little
lass, with an affectation of grown-up manners at their best which
was very quaint.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is such a pleasure to serve dear
old gentlemen like you; especially when one can see at once that
you have come from far over sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;I have been a
great traveller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I told this lie from pure politeness, in came the lad
again, with a tray in his hands, on which I saw a long flask and
two beautiful glasses.&nbsp; &ldquo;Neighbours,&rdquo; said the
girl (who did all the talking, her brother being very shy,
clearly) &ldquo;please to drink a glass to us before you go,
since we do not have guests like this every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith the boy put the tray on the counter and solemnly
poured out a straw-coloured wine into the long bowls.&nbsp;
Nothing loth, I drank, for I was thirsty with the hot day; and
thinks I, I am yet in the world, and the grapes of the Rhine have
not yet lost their flavour; for if ever I drank good Steinberg, I
drank it that morning; and I made a mental note to ask Dick how
they managed to make fine wine when there were no longer
labourers compelled to drink rot-gut instead of the fine wine
which they themselves made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you drink a glass to us, dear little
neighbours?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t drink wine,&rdquo; said the lass;
&ldquo;I like lemonade better: but I wish your health!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I like ginger-beer better,&rdquo; said the little
lad.</p>
<p>Well, well, thought I, neither have children&rsquo;s tastes
changed much.&nbsp; And therewith we gave them good day and went
out of the booth.</p>
<p>To my disappointment, like a change in a dream, a tall old man
was holding our horse instead of the beautiful woman.&nbsp; He
explained to us that the maiden could not wait, and that he had
taken her place; and he winked at us and laughed when he saw how
our faces fell, so that we had nothing for it but to laugh
also&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; said he to Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Bloomsbury,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you two don&rsquo;t want to be alone, I&rsquo;ll
come with you,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;tell me when you
want to get down and I&rsquo;ll stop for you.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s
get on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we got under way again; and I asked if children generally
waited on people in the markets.&nbsp; &ldquo;Often
enough,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when it isn&rsquo;t a matter of
dealing with heavy weights, but by no means always.&nbsp; The
children like to amuse themselves with it, and it is good for
them, because they handle a lot of diverse wares and get to learn
about them, how they are made, and where they come from, and so
on.&nbsp; Besides, it is such very easy work that anybody can do
it.&nbsp; It is said that in the early days of our epoch there
were a good many people who were hereditarily afflicted with a
disease called Idleness, because they were the direct descendants
of those who in the bad times used to force other people to work
for them&mdash;the people, you know, who are called slave-holders
or employers of labour in the history books.&nbsp; Well, these
Idleness-stricken people used to serve booths <i>all</i> their
time, because they were fit for so little.&nbsp; Indeed, I
believe that at one time they were actually <i>compelled</i> to
do some such work, because they, especially the women, got so
ugly and produced such ugly children if their disease was not
treated sharply, that the neighbours couldn&rsquo;t stand
it.&nbsp; However, I&rsquo;m happy to say that all that is gone
by now; the disease is either extinct, or exists in such a mild
form that a short course of aperient medicine carries it
off.&nbsp; It is sometimes called the Blue-devils now, or the
Mulleygrubs.&nbsp; Queer names, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, pondering much.&nbsp; But the old
man broke in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all that is true, neighbour; and I have seen some
of those poor women grown old.&nbsp; But my father used to know
some of them when they were young; and he said that they were as
little like young women as might be: they had hands like bunches
of skewers, and wretched little arms like sticks; and waists like
hour-glasses, and thin lips and peaked noses and pale cheeks; and
they were always pretending to be offended at anything you said
or did to them.&nbsp; No wonder they bore ugly children, for no
one except men like them could be in love with them&mdash;poor
things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, and seemed to be musing on his past life, and then
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know, neighbours, that once on a time people
were still anxious about that disease of Idleness: at one time we
gave ourselves a great deal of trouble in trying to cure people
of it.&nbsp; Have you not read any of the medical books on the
subject?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; for the old man was speaking to
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it was thought at the time
that it was the survival of the old medi&aelig;val disease of
leprosy: it seems it was very catching, for many of the people
afflicted by it were much secluded, and were waited upon by a
special class of diseased persons queerly dressed up, so that
they might be known.&nbsp; They wore amongst other garments,
breeches made of worsted velvet, that stuff which used to be
called plush some years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this seemed very interesting to me, and I should like to
have made the old man talk more.&nbsp; But Dick got rather
restive under so much ancient history: besides, I suspect he
wanted to keep me as fresh as he could for his
great-grandfather.&nbsp; So he burst out laughing at last, and
said: &ldquo;Excuse me, neighbours, but I can&rsquo;t help
it.&nbsp; Fancy people not liking to work!&mdash;it&rsquo;s too
ridiculous.&nbsp; Why, even you like to work, old
fellow&mdash;sometimes,&rdquo; said he, affectionately patting
the old horse with the whip.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a queer disease!
it may well be called Mulleygrubs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he laughed out again most boisterously; rather too much
so, I thought, for his usual good manners; and I laughed with him
for company&rsquo;s sake, but from the teeth outward only; for
<i>I</i> saw nothing funny in people not liking to work, as you
may well imagine.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII: TRAFALGAR SQUARE</h2>
<p>And now again I was busy looking about me, for we were quite
clear of Piccadilly Market, and were in a region of
elegantly-built much ornamented houses, which I should have
called villas if they had been ugly and pretentious, which was
very far from being the case.&nbsp; Each house stood in a garden
carefully cultivated, and running over with flowers.&nbsp; The
blackbirds were singing their best amidst the garden-trees,
which, except for a bay here and there, and occasional groups of
limes, seemed to be all fruit-trees: there were a great many
cherry-trees, now all laden with fruit; and several times as we
passed by a garden we were offered baskets of fine fruit by
children and young girls.&nbsp; Amidst all these gardens and
houses it was of course impossible to trace the sites of the old
streets: but it seemed to me that the main roadways were the same
as of old.</p>
<p>We came presently into a large open space, sloping somewhat
toward the south, the sunny site of which had been taken
advantage of for planting an orchard, mainly, as I could see, of
apricot-trees, in the midst of which was a pretty gay little
structure of wood, painted and gilded, that looked like a
refreshment-stall.&nbsp; From the southern side of the said
orchard ran a long road, chequered over with the shadow of tall
old pear trees, at the end of which showed the high tower of the
Parliament House, or Dung Market.</p>
<p>A strange sensation came over me; I shut my eyes to keep out
the sight of the sun glittering on this fair abode of gardens,
and for a moment there passed before them a phantasmagoria of
another day.&nbsp; A great space surrounded by tall ugly houses,
with an ugly church at the corner and a nondescript ugly cupolaed
building at my back; the roadway thronged with a sweltering and
excited crowd, dominated by omnibuses crowded with
spectators.&nbsp; In the midst a paved be-fountained square,
populated only by a few men dressed in blue, and a good many
singularly ugly bronze images (one on the top of a tall
column).&nbsp; The said square guarded up to the edge of the
roadway by a four-fold line of big men clad in blue, and across
the southern roadway the helmets of a band of horse-soldiers,
dead white in the greyness of the chilly November
afternoon&mdash;I opened my eyes to the sunlight again and looked
round me, and cried out among the whispering trees and odorous
blossoms, &ldquo;Trafalgar Square!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dick, who had drawn rein again,
&ldquo;so it is.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wonder at your finding the
name ridiculous: but after all, it was nobody&rsquo;s business to
alter it, since the name of a dead folly doesn&rsquo;t
bite.&nbsp; Yet sometimes I think we might have given it a name
which would have commemorated the great battle which was fought
on the spot itself in 1952,&mdash;that was important enough, if
the historians don&rsquo;t lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which they generally do, or at least did,&rdquo; said
the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;For instance, what can you make of
this, neighbours?&nbsp; I have read a muddled account in a
book&mdash;O a stupid book&mdash;called James&rsquo; Social
Democratic History, of a fight which took place here in or about
the year 1887 (I am bad at dates).&nbsp; Some people, says this
story, were going to hold a ward-mote here, or some such thing,
and the Government of London, or the Council, or the Commission,
or what not other barbarous half-hatched body of fools, fell upon
these citizens (as they were then called) with the armed
hand.&nbsp; That seems too ridiculous to be true; but according
to this version of the story, nothing much came of it, which
certainly <i>is</i> too ridiculous to be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;but after all your Mr.
James is right so far, and it <i>is</i> true; except that there
was no fighting, merely unarmed and peaceable people attacked by
ruffians armed with bludgeons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they put up with that?&rdquo; said Dick, with the
first unpleasant expression I had seen on his good-tempered
face.</p>
<p>Said I, reddening: &ldquo;We <i>had</i> to put up with it; we
couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at me keenly, and said: &ldquo;You seem to
know a great deal about it, neighbour!&nbsp; And is it really
true that nothing came of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This came of it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that a good many
people were sent to prison because of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, of the bludgeoners?&rdquo; said the old
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor devils!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of the
bludgeoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the old man rather severely: &ldquo;Friend, I expect that
you have been reading some rotten collection of lies, and have
been taken in by it too easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what I have been
saying is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I am sure you think so, neighbour,&rdquo;
said the old man, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see why you should be
so cocksure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I couldn&rsquo;t explain why, I held my tongue.&nbsp;
Meanwhile Dick, who had been sitting with knit brows, cogitating,
spoke at last, and said gently and rather sadly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange to think that there have been men like
ourselves, and living in this beautiful and happy country, who I
suppose had feelings and affections like ourselves, who could yet
do such dreadful things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, in a didactic tone; &ldquo;yet
after all, even those days were a great improvement on the days
that had gone before them.&nbsp; Have you not read of the
Medi&aelig;val period, and the ferocity of its criminal laws; and
how in those days men fairly seemed to have enjoyed tormenting
their fellow men?&mdash;nay, for the matter of that, they made
their God a tormentor and a jailer rather than anything
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;there are good books on
that period also, some of which I have read.&nbsp; But as to the
great improvement of the nineteenth century, I don&rsquo;t see
it.&nbsp; After all, the Medi&aelig;val folk acted after their
conscience, as your remark about their God (which is true) shows,
and they were ready to bear what they inflicted on others;
whereas the nineteenth century ones were hypocrites, and
pretended to be humane, and yet went on tormenting those whom
they dared to treat so by shutting them up in prison, for no
reason at all, except that they were what they themselves, the
prison-masters, had forced them to be.&nbsp; O, it&rsquo;s
horrible to think of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they did not know
what the prisons were like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick seemed roused, and even angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;More shame
for them,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when you and I know it all these
years afterwards.&nbsp; Look you, neighbour, they couldn&rsquo;t
fail to know what a disgrace a prison is to the Commonwealth at
the best, and that their prisons were a good step on towards
being at the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quoth I: &ldquo;But have you no prisons at all now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the words were out of my mouth, I felt that I had
made a mistake, for Dick flushed red and frowned, and the old man
looked surprised and pained; and presently Dick said angrily, yet
as if restraining himself somewhat&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man alive! how can you ask such a question?&nbsp; Have
I not told you that we know what a prison means by the undoubted
evidence of really trustworthy books, helped out by our own
imaginations?&nbsp; And haven&rsquo;t you specially called me to
notice that the people about the roads and streets look happy?
and how could they look happy if they knew that their neighbours
were shut up in prison, while they bore such things
quietly?&nbsp; And if there were people in prison, you
couldn&rsquo;t hide it from folk, like you may an occasional
man-slaying; because that isn&rsquo;t done of set purpose, with a
lot of people backing up the slayer in cold blood, as this prison
business is.&nbsp; Prisons, indeed!&nbsp; O no, no,
no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, and began to cool down, and said in a kind voice:
&ldquo;But forgive me!&nbsp; I needn&rsquo;t be so hot about it,
since there are <i>not</i> any prisons: I&rsquo;m afraid you will
think the worse of me for losing my temper.&nbsp; Of course, you,
coming from the outlands, cannot be expected to know about these
things.&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;m afraid I have made you feel
uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a way he had; but he was so generous in his heat, that I
liked him the better for it, and I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, really &rsquo;tis all my fault for being so
stupid.&nbsp; Let me change the subject, and ask you what the
stately building is on our left just showing at the end of that
grove of plane-trees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is an old building
built before the middle of the twentieth century, and as you see,
in a queer fantastic style not over beautiful; but there are some
fine things inside it, too, mostly pictures, some very old.&nbsp;
It is called the National Gallery; I have sometimes puzzled as to
what the name means: anyhow, nowadays wherever there is a place
where pictures are kept as curiosities permanently it is called a
National Gallery, perhaps after this one.&nbsp; Of course there
are a good many of them up and down the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t try to enlighten him, feeling the task too
heavy; but I pulled out my magnificent pipe and fell a-smoking,
and the old horse jogged on again.&nbsp; As we went, I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This pipe is a very elaborate toy, and you seem so
reasonable in this country, and your architecture is so good,
that I rather wonder at your turning out such
trivialities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck me as I spoke that this was rather ungrateful of me,
after having received such a fine present; but Dick didn&rsquo;t
seem to notice my bad manners, but said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know; it is a pretty thing, and
since nobody need make such things unless they like, I
don&rsquo;t see why they shouldn&rsquo;t make them, if they
like.&nbsp; Of course, if carvers were scarce they would all be
busy on the architecture, as you call it, and then these
&lsquo;toys&rsquo; (a good word) would not be made; but since
there are plenty of people who can carve&mdash;in fact, almost
everybody, and as work is somewhat scarce, or we are afraid it
may be, folk do not discourage this kind of petty
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mused a little, and seemed somewhat perturbed; but
presently his face cleared, and he said: &ldquo;After all, you
must admit that the pipe is a very pretty thing, with the little
people under the trees all cut so clean and sweet;&mdash;too
elaborate for a pipe, perhaps, but&mdash;well, it is very
pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too valuable for its use, perhaps,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was just going in a helpless way to try to make him
understand, when we came by the gates of a big rambling building,
in which work of some sort seemed going on.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
building is that?&rdquo; said I, eagerly; for it was a pleasure
amidst all these strange things to see something a little like
what I was used to: &ldquo;it seems to be a factory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I know what you
mean, and that&rsquo;s what it is; but we don&rsquo;t call them
factories now, but Banded-workshops: that is, places where people
collect who want to work together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;power of some sort is
used there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should people
collect together to use power, when they can have it at the
places where they live, or hard by, any two or three of them; or
any one, for the matter of that?&nbsp; No; folk collect in these
Banded-workshops to do hand-work in which working together is
necessary or convenient; such work is often very pleasant.&nbsp;
In there, for instance, they make pottery and glass,&mdash;there,
you can see the tops of the furnaces.&nbsp; Well, of course
it&rsquo;s handy to have fair-sized ovens and kilns and
glass-pots, and a good lot of things to use them for: though of
course there are a good many such places, as it would be
ridiculous if a man had a liking for pot-making or glass-blowing
that he should have to live in one place or be obliged to forego
the work he liked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no smoke coming from the furnaces,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke?&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;why should you see
smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I held my tongue, and he went on: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice
place inside, though as plain as you see outside.&nbsp; As to the
crafts, throwing the clay must be jolly work: the glass-blowing
is rather a sweltering job; but some folk like it very much
indeed; and I don&rsquo;t much wonder: there is such a sense of
power, when you have got deft in it, in dealing with the hot
metal.&nbsp; It makes a lot of pleasant work,&rdquo; said he,
smiling, &ldquo;for however much care you take of such goods,
break they will, one day or another, so there is always plenty to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I held my tongue and pondered.</p>
<p>We came just here on a gang of men road-mending which delayed
us a little; but I was not sorry for it; for all I had seen
hitherto seemed a mere part of a summer holiday; and I wanted to
see how this folk would set to on a piece of real necessary
work.&nbsp; They had been resting, and had only just begun work
again as we came up; so that the rattle of the picks was what
woke me from my musing.&nbsp; There were about a dozen of them,
strong young men, looking much like a boating party at Oxford
would have looked in the days I remembered, and not more troubled
with their work: their outer raiment lay on the road-side in an
orderly pile under the guardianship of a six-year-old boy, who
had his arm thrown over the neck of a big mastiff, who was as
happily lazy as if the summer-day had been made for him
alone.&nbsp; As I eyed the pile of clothes, I could see the gleam
of gold and silk embroidery on it, and judged that some of these
workmen had tastes akin to those of the Golden Dustman of
Hammersmith.&nbsp; Beside them lay a good big basket that had
hints about it of cold pie and wine: a half dozen of young women
stood by watching the work or the workers, both of which were
worth watching, for the latter smote great strokes and were very
deft in their labour, and as handsome clean-built fellows as you
might find a dozen of in a summer day.&nbsp; They were laughing
and talking merrily with each other and the women, but presently
their foreman looked up and saw our way stopped.&nbsp; So he
stayed his pick and sang out, &ldquo;Spell ho, mates! here are
neighbours want to get past.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereon the others
stopped also, and, drawing around us, helped the old horse by
easing our wheels over the half undone road, and then, like men
with a pleasant task on hand, hurried back to their work, only
stopping to give us a smiling good-day; so that the sound of the
picks broke out again before Greylocks had taken to his
jog-trot.&nbsp; Dick looked back over his shoulder at them and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are in luck to-day: it&rsquo;s right down good
sport trying how much pick-work one can get into an hour; and I
can see those neighbours know their business well.&nbsp; It is
not a mere matter of strength getting on quickly with such work;
is it, guest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but to tell
you the truth, I have never tried my hand at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said he gravely, &ldquo;that seems a
pity; it is good work for hardening the muscles, and I like it;
though I admit it is pleasanter the second week than the
first.&nbsp; Not that I am a good hand at it: the fellows used to
chaff me at one job where I was working, I remember, and sing out
to me, &lsquo;Well rowed, stroke!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Put your
back into it, bow!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of a joke,&rdquo; quoth I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;everything seems like a
joke when we have a pleasant spell of work on, and good fellows
merry about us; we feels so happy, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again I
pondered silently.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII: AN OLD FRIEND</h2>
<p>We now turned into a pleasant lane where the branches of great
plane-trees nearly met overhead, but behind them lay low houses
standing rather close together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Long Acre,&rdquo; quoth Dick; &ldquo;so there
must once have been a cornfield here.&nbsp; How curious it is
that places change so, and yet keep their old names!&nbsp; Just
look how thick the houses stand! and they are still going on
building, look you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;but I think the
cornfields must have been built over before the middle of the
nineteenth century.&nbsp; I have heard that about here was one of
the thickest parts of the town.&nbsp; But I must get down here,
neighbours; I have got to call on a friend who lives in the
gardens behind this Long Acre.&nbsp; Good-bye and good luck,
Guest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he jumped down and strode away vigorously, like a young
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old should you say that neighbour will be?&rdquo;
said I to Dick as we lost sight of him; for I saw that he was
old, and yet he looked dry and sturdy like a piece of old oak; a
type of old man I was not used to seeing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, about ninety, I should say,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long-lived your people must be!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;certainly we have beaten
the threescore-and-ten of the old Jewish proverb-book.&nbsp; But
then you see that was written of Syria, a hot dry country, where
people live faster than in our temperate climate.&nbsp; However,
I don&rsquo;t think it matters much, so long as a man is healthy
and happy while he <i>is</i> alive.&nbsp; But now, Guest, we are
so near to my old kinsman&rsquo;s dwelling-place that I think you
had better keep all future questions for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded a yes; and therewith we turned to the left, and went
down a gentle slope through some beautiful rose-gardens, laid out
on what I took to be the site of Endell Street.&nbsp; We passed
on, and Dick drew rein an instant as we came across a long
straightish road with houses scantily scattered up and down
it.&nbsp; He waved his hand right and left, and said,
&ldquo;Holborn that side, Oxford Road that.&nbsp; This was once a
very important part of the crowded city outside the ancient walls
of the Roman and Medi&aelig;val burg: many of the feudal nobles
of the Middle Ages, we are told, had big houses on either side of
Holborn.&nbsp; I daresay you remember that the Bishop of
Ely&rsquo;s house is mentioned in Shakespeare&rsquo;s play of
King Richard III.; and there are some remains of that still
left.&nbsp; However, this road is not of the same importance, now
that the ancient city is gone, walls and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drove on again, while I smiled faintly to think how the
nineteenth century, of which such big words have been said,
counted for nothing in the memory of this man, who read
Shakespeare and had not forgotten the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>We crossed the road into a short narrow lane between the
gardens, and came out again into a wide road, on one side of
which was a great and long building, turning its gables away from
the highway, which I saw at once was another public group.&nbsp;
Opposite to it was a wide space of greenery, without any wall or
fence of any kind.&nbsp; I looked through the trees and saw
beyond them a pillared portico quite familiar to me&mdash;no less
old a friend, in fact, than the British Museum.&nbsp; It rather
took my breath away, amidst all the strange things I had seen;
but I held my tongue and let Dick speak.&nbsp; Said he:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder is the British Museum, where my
great-grandfather mostly lives; so I won&rsquo;t say much about
it.&nbsp; The building on the left is the Museum Market, and I
think we had better turn in there for a minute or two; for
Greylocks will be wanting his rest and his oats; and I suppose
you will stay with my kinsman the greater part of the day; and to
say the truth, there may be some one there whom I particularly
want to see, and perhaps have a long talk with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blushed and sighed, not altogether with pleasure, I
thought; so of course I said nothing, and he turned the horse
under an archway which brought us into a very large paved
quadrangle, with a big sycamore tree in each corner and a
plashing fountain in the midst.&nbsp; Near the fountain were a
few market stalls, with awnings over them of gay striped linen
cloth, about which some people, mostly women and children, were
moving quietly, looking at the goods exposed there.&nbsp; The
ground floor of the building round the quadrangle was occupied by
a wide arcade or cloister, whose fanciful but strong architecture
I could not enough admire.&nbsp; Here also a few people were
sauntering or sitting reading on the benches.</p>
<p>Dick said to me apologetically: &ldquo;Here as elsewhere there
is little doing to-day; on a Friday you would see it thronged,
and gay with people, and in the afternoon there is generally
music about the fountain.&nbsp; However, I daresay we shall have
a pretty good gathering at our mid-day meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We drove through the quadrangle and by an archway, into a
large handsome stable on the other side, where we speedily
stalled the old nag and made him happy with horse-meat, and then
turned and walked back again through the market, Dick looking
rather thoughtful, as it seemed to me.</p>
<p>I noticed that people couldn&rsquo;t help looking at me rather
hard, and considering my clothes and theirs, I didn&rsquo;t
wonder; but whenever they caught my eye they made me a very
friendly sign of greeting.</p>
<p>We walked straight into the forecourt of the Museum, where,
except that the railings were gone, and the whispering boughs of
the trees were all about, nothing seemed changed; the very
pigeons were wheeling about the building and clinging to the
ornaments of the pediment as I had seen them of old.</p>
<p>Dick seemed grown a little absent, but he could not forbear
giving me an architectural note, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rather an ugly old building, isn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; Many people have wanted to pull it down and rebuild it:
and perhaps if work does really get scarce we may yet do
so.&nbsp; But, as my great grandfather will tell you, it would
not be quite a straightforward job; for there are wonderful
collections in there of all kinds of antiquities, besides an
enormous library with many exceedingly beautiful books in it, and
many most useful ones as genuine records, texts of ancient works
and the like; and the worry and anxiety, and even risk, there
would be in moving all this has saved the buildings
themselves.&nbsp; Besides, as we said before, it is not a bad
thing to have some record of what our forefathers thought a
handsome building.&nbsp; For there is plenty of labour and
material in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see there is,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I quite agree
with you.&nbsp; But now hadn&rsquo;t we better make haste to see
your great-grandfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, I could not help seeing that he was rather dallying
with the time.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;Yes, we will go into the
house in a minute.&nbsp; My kinsman is too old to do much work in
the Museum, where he was a custodian of the books for many years;
but he still lives here a good deal; indeed I think,&rdquo; said
he, smiling, &ldquo;that he looks upon himself as a part of the
books, or the books a part of him, I don&rsquo;t know
which.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated a little longer, then flushing up, took my hand,
and saying, &ldquo;Come along, then!&rdquo; led me toward the
door of one of the old official dwellings.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX: CONCERNING LOVE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Your kinsman doesn&rsquo;t much care for beautiful
building, then,&rdquo; said I, as we entered the rather dreary
classical house; which indeed was as bare as need be, except for
some big pots of the June flowers which stood about here and
there; though it was very clean and nicely whitewashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Dick, rather
absently.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is getting old, certainly, for he is
over a hundred and five, and no doubt he doesn&rsquo;t care about
moving.&nbsp; But of course he could live in a prettier house if
he liked: he is not obliged to live in one place any more than
any one else.&nbsp; This way, Guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he led the way upstairs, and opening a door we went into a
fair-sized room of the old type, as plain as the rest of the
house, with a few necessary pieces of furniture, and those very
simple and even rude, but solid and with a good deal of carving
about them, well designed but rather crudely executed.&nbsp; At
the furthest corner of the room, at a desk near the window, sat a
little old man in a roomy oak chair, well becushioned.&nbsp; He
was dressed in a sort of Norfolk jacket of blue serge worn
threadbare, with breeches of the same, and grey worsted
stockings.&nbsp; He jumped up from his chair, and cried out in a
voice of considerable volume for such an old man, &ldquo;Welcome,
Dick, my lad; Clara is here, and will be more than glad to see
you; so keep your heart up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara here?&rdquo; quoth Dick; &ldquo;if I had known, I
would not have brought&mdash;At least, I mean I
would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stuttering and confused, clearly because he was anxious
to say nothing to make me feel one too many.&nbsp; But the old
man, who had not seen me at first, helped him out by coming
forward and saying to me in a kind tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray pardon me, for I did not notice that Dick, who is
big enough to hide anybody, you know, had brought a friend with
him.&nbsp; A most hearty welcome to you!&nbsp; All the more, as I
almost hope that you are going to amuse an old man by giving him
news from over sea, for I can see that you are come from over the
water and far off countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me thoughtfully, almost anxiously, as he said in
a changed voice, &ldquo;Might I ask you where you come from, as
you are so clearly a stranger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said in an absent way: &ldquo;I used to live in England, and
now I am come back again; and I slept last night at the
Hammersmith Guest House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed gravely, but seemed, I thought, a little disappointed
with my answer.&nbsp; As for me, I was now looking at him harder
than good manners allowed of; perhaps; for in truth his face,
dried-apple-like as it was, seemed strangely familiar to me; as
if I had seen it before&mdash;in a looking-glass it might be,
said I to myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;wherever you come
from, you are come among friends.&nbsp; And I see my kinsman
Richard Hammond has an air about him as if he had brought you
here for me to do something for you.&nbsp; Is that so,
Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, who was getting still more absent-minded and kept
looking uneasily at the door, managed to say, &ldquo;Well, yes,
kinsman: our guest finds things much altered, and cannot
understand it; nor can I; so I thought I would bring him to you,
since you know more of all that has happened within the last two
hundred years than any body else does.&mdash;What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he turned toward the door again.&nbsp; We heard footsteps
outside; the door opened, and in came a very beautiful young
woman, who stopped short on seeing Dick, and flushed as red as a
rose, but faced him nevertheless.&nbsp; Dick looked at her hard,
and half reached out his hand toward her, and his whole face
quivered with emotion.</p>
<p>The old man did not leave them long in this shy discomfort,
but said, smiling with an old man&rsquo;s mirth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, my lad, and you, my dear Clara, I rather think
that we two oldsters are in your way; for I think you will have
plenty to say to each other.&nbsp; You had better go into
Nelson&rsquo;s room up above; I know he has gone out; and he has
just been covering the walls all over with medi&aelig;val books,
so it will be pretty enough even for you two and your renewed
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl reached out her hand to Dick, and taking his led him
out of the room, looking straight before her; but it was easy to
see that her blushes came from happiness, not anger; as, indeed,
love is far more self-conscious than wrath.</p>
<p>When the door had shut on them the old man turned to me, still
smiling, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, my dear guest, you will do me a great service
if you are come to set my old tongue wagging.&nbsp; My love of
talk still abides with me, or rather grows on me; and though it
is pleasant enough to see these youngsters moving about and
playing together so seriously, as if the whole world depended on
their kisses (as indeed it does somewhat), yet I don&rsquo;t
think my tales of the past interest them much.&nbsp; The last
harvest, the last baby, the last knot of carving in the
market-place, is history enough for them.&nbsp; It was different,
I think, when I was a lad, when we were not so assured of peace
and continuous plenty as we are now&mdash;Well, well!&nbsp;
Without putting you to the question, let me ask you this: Am I to
consider you as an enquirer who knows a little of our modern ways
of life, or as one who comes from some place where the very
foundations of life are different from ours,&mdash;do you know
anything or nothing about us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me keenly and with growing wonder in his eyes as
he spoke; and I answered in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know only so much of your modern life as I could
gather from using my eyes on the way here from Hammersmith, and
from asking some questions of Richard Hammond, most of which he
could hardly understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled at this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I am to speak to you as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I were a being from another planet,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>The old man, whose name, by the bye, like his kinsman&rsquo;s,
was Hammond, smiled and nodded, and wheeling his seat round to
me, bade me sit in a heavy oak chair, and said, as he saw my eyes
fix on its curious carving:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am much tied to the past, my past, you
understand.&nbsp; These very pieces of furniture belong to a time
before my early days; it was my father who got them made; if they
had been done within the last fifty years they would have been
much cleverer in execution; but I don&rsquo;t think I should have
liked them the better.&nbsp; We were almost beginning again in
those days: and they were brisk, hot-headed times.&nbsp; But you
hear how garrulous I am: ask me questions, ask me questions about
anything, dear guest; since I must talk, make my talk profitable
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was silent for a minute, and then I said, somewhat
nervously: &ldquo;Excuse me if I am rude; but I am so much
interested in Richard, since he has been so kind to me, a perfect
stranger, that I should like to ask a question about
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said old Hammond, &ldquo;if he were not
&lsquo;kind&rsquo;, as you call it, to a perfect stranger he
would be thought a strange person, and people would be apt to
shun him.&nbsp; But ask on, ask on! don&rsquo;t be shy of
asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;That beautiful girl, is he going to be married
to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;yes, he is.&nbsp; He has
been married to her once already, and now I should say it is
pretty clear that he will be married to her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; quoth I, wondering what that meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the whole tale,&rdquo; said old Hammond;
&ldquo;a short one enough; and now I hope a happy one: they lived
together two years the first time; were both very young; and then
she got it into her head that she was in love with somebody
else.&nbsp; So she left poor Dick; I say <i>poor</i> Dick,
because he had not found any one else.&nbsp; But it did not last
long, only about a year.&nbsp; Then she came to me, as she was in
the habit of bringing her troubles to the old carle, and asked me
how Dick was, and whether he was happy, and all the rest of
it.&nbsp; So I saw how the land lay, and said that he was very
unhappy, and not at all well; which last at any rate was a
lie.&nbsp; There, you can guess the rest.&nbsp; Clara came to
have a long talk with me to-day, but Dick will serve her turn
much better.&nbsp; Indeed, if he hadn&rsquo;t chanced in upon me
to-day I should have had to have sent for him
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have they any
children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;two; they are staying with
one of my daughters at present, where, indeed, Clara has mostly
been.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t lose sight of her, as I felt sure
they would come together again: and Dick, who is the best of good
fellows, really took the matter to heart.&nbsp; You see, he had
no other love to run to, as she had.&nbsp; So I managed it all;
as I have done with such-like matters before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;no doubt you wanted to keep
them out of the Divorce Court: but I suppose it often has to
settle such matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you suppose nonsense,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know that there used to be such lunatic affairs as
divorce-courts: but just consider; all the cases that came into
them were matters of property quarrels: and I think, dear
guest,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;that though you do come
from another planet, you can see from the mere outside look of
our world that quarrels about private property could not go on
amongst us in our days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, my drive from Hammersmith to Bloomsbury, and all the
quiet happy life I had seen so many hints of; even apart from my
shopping, would have been enough to tell me that &ldquo;the
sacred rights of property,&rdquo; as we used to think of them,
were now no more.&nbsp; So I sat silent while the old man took up
the thread of the discourse again, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, property quarrels being no longer possible,
what remains in these matters that a court of law could deal
with?&nbsp; Fancy a court for enforcing a contract of passion or
sentiment!&nbsp; If such a thing were needed as a <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i> of the enforcement of contract, such a folly would
do that for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent again a little, and then said: &ldquo;You must
understand once for all that we have changed these matters; or
rather, that our way of looking at them has changed, as we have
changed within the last two hundred years.&nbsp; We do not
deceive ourselves, indeed, or believe that we can get rid of all
the trouble that besets the dealings between the sexes.&nbsp; We
know that we must face the unhappiness that comes of man and
woman confusing the relations between natural passion, and
sentiment, and the friendship which, when things go well, softens
the awakening from passing illusions: but we are not so mad as to
pile up degradation on that unhappiness by engaging in sordid
squabbles about livelihood and position, and the power of
tyrannising over the children who have been the results of love
or lust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he paused awhile, and again went on: &ldquo;Calf love,
mistaken for a heroism that shall be lifelong, yet early waning
into disappointment; the inexplicable desire that comes on a man
of riper years to be the all-in-all to some one woman, whose
ordinary human kindness and human beauty he has idealised into
superhuman perfection, and made the one object of his desire; or
lastly the reasonable longing of a strong and thoughtful man to
become the most intimate friend of some beautiful and wise woman,
the very type of the beauty and glory of the world which we love
so well,&mdash;as we exult in all the pleasure and exaltation of
spirit which goes with these things, so we set ourselves to bear
the sorrow which not unseldom goes with them also; remembering
those lines of the ancient poet (I quote roughly from memory one
of the many translations of the nineteenth century):</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;For this the Gods have fashioned
man&rsquo;s grief and evil day<br />
That still for man hereafter might be the tale and the
lay.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, well, &rsquo;tis little likely anyhow that all tales
shall be lacking, or all sorrow cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent for some time, and I would not interrupt
him.&nbsp; At last he began again: &ldquo;But you must know that
we of these generations are strong and healthy of body, and live
easily; we pass our lives in reasonable strife with nature,
exercising not one side of ourselves only, but all sides, taking
the keenest pleasure in all the life of the world.&nbsp; So it is
a point of honour with us not to be self-centred; not to suppose
that the world must cease because one man is sorry; therefore we
should think it foolish, or if you will, criminal, to exaggerate
these matters of sentiment and sensibility: we are no more
inclined to eke out our sentimental sorrows than to cherish our
bodily pains; and we recognise that there are other pleasures
besides love-making.&nbsp; You must remember, also, that we are
long-lived, and that therefore beauty both in man and woman is
not so fleeting as it was in the days when we were burdened so
heavily by self-inflicted diseases.&nbsp; So we shake off these
griefs in a way which perhaps the sentimentalists of other times
would think contemptible and unheroic, but which we think
necessary and manlike.&nbsp; As on the other hand, therefore, we
have ceased to be commercial in our love-matters, so also we have
ceased to be <i>artificially</i> foolish.&nbsp; The folly which
comes by nature, the unwisdom of the immature man, or the older
man caught in a trap, we must put up with that, nor are we much
ashamed of it; but to be conventionally sensitive or
sentimental&mdash;my friend, I am old and perhaps disappointed,
but at least I think we have cast off <i>some</i> of the follies
of the older world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, as if for some words of mine; but I held my peace:
then he went on: &ldquo;At least, if we suffer from the tyranny
and fickleness of nature or our own want of experience, we
neither grimace about it, nor lie.&nbsp; If there must be
sundering betwixt those who meant never to sunder, so it must be:
but there need be no pretext of unity when the reality of it is
gone: nor do we drive those who well know that they are incapable
of it to profess an undying sentiment which they cannot really
feel: thus it is that as that monstrosity of venal lust is no
longer possible, so also it is no longer needed.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me.&nbsp; You did not seemed shocked
when I told you that there were no law-courts to enforce
contracts of sentiment or passion; but so curiously are men made,
that perhaps you will be shocked when I tell you that there is no
code of public opinion which takes the place of such courts, and
which might be as tyrannical and unreasonable as they were.&nbsp;
I do not say that people don&rsquo;t judge their
neighbours&rsquo; conduct, sometimes, doubtless, unfairly.&nbsp;
But I do say that there is no unvarying conventional set of rules
by which people are judged; no bed of Procrustes to stretch or
cramp their minds and lives; no hypocritical excommunication
which people are <i>forced</i> to pronounce, either by
unconsidered habit, or by the unexpressed threat of the lesser
interdict if they are lax in their hypocrisy.&nbsp; Are you
shocked now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-o&mdash;no,&rdquo; said I, with some
hesitation.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is all so different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;one thing I think I
can answer for: whatever sentiment there is, it is real&mdash;and
general; it is not confined to people very specially
refined.&nbsp; I am also pretty sure, as I hinted to you just
now, that there is not by a great way as much suffering involved
in these matters either to men or to women as there used to
be.&nbsp; But excuse me for being so prolix on this
question!&nbsp; You know you asked to be treated like a being
from another planet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I thank you very much,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now may I ask you about the position of women in your
society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed very heartily for a man of his years, and said:
&ldquo;It is not without reason that I have got a reputation as a
careful student of history.&nbsp; I believe I really do
understand &lsquo;the Emancipation of Women movement&rsquo; of
the nineteenth century.&nbsp; I doubt if any other man now alive
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said I, a little bit nettled by his
merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of course you will see
that all that is a dead controversy now.&nbsp; The men have no
longer any opportunity of tyrannising over the women, or the
women over the men; both of which things took place in those old
times.&nbsp; The women do what they can do best, and what they
like best, and the men are neither jealous of it or injured by
it.&nbsp; This is such a commonplace that I am almost ashamed to
state it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;O; and legislation? do they take any part in
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond smiled and said: &ldquo;I think you may wait for an
answer to that question till we get on to the subject of
legislation.&nbsp; There may be novelties to you in that subject
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but about this woman
question?&nbsp; I saw at the Guest House that the women were
waiting on the men: that seems a little like reaction
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it?&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;perhaps you
think housekeeping an unimportant occupation, not deserving of
respect.&nbsp; I believe that was the opinion of the
&lsquo;advanced&rsquo; women of the nineteenth century, and their
male backers.&nbsp; If it is yours, I recommend to your notice an
old Norwegian folk-lore tale called How the Man minded the House,
or some such title; the result of which minding was that, after
various tribulations, the man and the family cow balanced each
other at the end of a rope, the man hanging halfway up the
chimney, the cow dangling from the roof, which, after the fashion
of the country, was of turf and sloping down low to the
ground.&nbsp; Hard on the cow, <i>I</i> think.&nbsp; Of course no
such mishap could happen to such a superior person as
yourself,&rdquo; he added, chuckling.</p>
<p>I sat somewhat uneasy under this dry gibe.&nbsp; Indeed, his
manner of treating this latter part of the question seemed to me
a little disrespectful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, now, my friend,&rdquo; quoth he,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that it is a great pleasure to a
clever woman to manage a house skilfully, and to do it so that
all the house-mates about her look pleased, and are grateful to
her?&nbsp; And then, you know, everybody likes to be ordered
about by a pretty woman: why, it is one of the pleasantest forms
of flirtation.&nbsp; You are not so old that you cannot remember
that.&nbsp; Why, I remember it well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the old fellow chuckled again, and at last fairly burst
out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said he, after a while; &ldquo;I am
not laughing at anything you could be thinking of; but at that
silly nineteenth-century fashion, current amongst rich so-called
cultivated people, of ignoring all the steps by which their daily
dinner was reached, as matters too low for their lofty
intelligence.&nbsp; Useless idiots!&nbsp; Come, now, I am a
&lsquo;literary man,&rsquo; as we queer animals used to be
called, yet I am a pretty good cook myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I really think you
can understand me better than you would seem to do, judging by
your words and your silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;Perhaps that is so; but people putting in
practice commonly this sense of interest in the ordinary
occupations of life rather startles me.&nbsp; I will ask you a
question or two presently about that.&nbsp; But I want to return
to the position of women amongst you.&nbsp; You have studied the
&lsquo;emancipation of women&rsquo; business of the nineteenth
century: don&rsquo;t you remember that some of the
&lsquo;superior&rsquo; women wanted to emancipate the more
intelligent part of their sex from the bearing of
children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man grew quite serious again.&nbsp; Said he: &ldquo;I
<i>do</i> remember about that strange piece of baseless folly,
the result, like all other follies of the period, of the hideous
class tyranny which then obtained.&nbsp; What do we think of it
now? you would say.&nbsp; My friend, that is a question easy to
answer.&nbsp; How could it possibly be but that maternity should
be highly honoured amongst us?&nbsp; Surely it is a matter of
course that the natural and necessary pains which the mother must
go through form a bond of union between man and woman, an extra
stimulus to love and affection between them, and that this is
universally recognised.&nbsp; For the rest, remember that all the
<i>artificial</i> burdens of motherhood are now done away
with.&nbsp; A mother has no longer any mere sordid anxieties for
the future of her children.&nbsp; They may indeed turn out better
or worse; they may disappoint her highest hopes; such anxieties
as these are a part of the mingled pleasure and pain which goes
to make up the life of mankind.&nbsp; But at least she is spared
the fear (it was most commonly the certainty) that artificial
disabilities would make her children something less than men and
women: she knows that they will live and act according to the
measure of their own faculties.&nbsp; In times past, it is clear
that the &lsquo;Society&rsquo; of the day helped its Judaic god,
and the &lsquo;Man of Science&rsquo; of the time, in visiting the
sins of the fathers upon the children.&nbsp; How to reverse this
process, how to take the sting out of heredity, has for long been
one of the most constant cares of the thoughtful men amongst
us.&nbsp; So that, you see, the ordinarily healthy woman (and
almost all our women are both healthy and at least comely),
respected as a child-bearer and rearer of children, desired as a
woman, loved as a companion, unanxious for the future of her
children, has far more instinct for maternity than the poor
drudge and mother of drudges of past days could ever have had; or
than her sister of the upper classes, brought up in affected
ignorance of natural facts, reared in an atmosphere of mingled
prudery and prurience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak warmly,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I can see
that you are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I will point out to you
a token of all the benefits which we have gained by our
freedom.&nbsp; What did you think of the looks of the people whom
you have come across to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;I could hardly have believed that there could
be so many good-looking people in any civilised
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crowed a little, like the old bird he was.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What! are we still civilised?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, as to our looks, the English and Jutish blood, which
on the whole is predominant here, used not to produce much
beauty.&nbsp; But I think we have improved it.&nbsp; I know a man
who has a large collection of portraits printed from photographs
of the nineteenth century, and going over those and comparing
them with the everyday faces in these times, puts the improvement
in our good looks beyond a doubt.&nbsp; Now, there are some
people who think it not too fantastic to connect this increase of
beauty directly with our freedom and good sense in the matters we
have been speaking of: they believe that a child born from the
natural and healthy love between a man and a woman, even if that
be transient, is likely to turn out better in all ways, and
especially in bodily beauty, than the birth of the respectable
commercial marriage bed, or of the dull despair of the drudge of
that system.&nbsp; They say, Pleasure begets pleasure.&nbsp; What
do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much of that mind,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old man, shifting in his chair,
&ldquo;you must get on with your questions, Guest; I have been
some time answering this first one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;I want an extra word or two about your ideas of
education; although I gathered from Dick that you let your
children run wild and didn&rsquo;t teach them anything; and in
short, that you have so refined your education, that now you have
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you gathered left-handed,&rdquo; quoth he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But of course I understand your point of view about
education, which is that of times past, when &lsquo;the struggle
for life,&rsquo; as men used to phrase it (<i>i.e.</i>, the
struggle for a slave&rsquo;s rations on one side, and for a
bouncing share of the slave-holders&rsquo; privilege on the
other), pinched &lsquo;education&rsquo; for most people into a
niggardly dole of not very accurate information; something to be
swallowed by the beginner in the art of living whether he liked
it or not, and was hungry for it or not: and which had been
chewed and digested over and over again by people who
didn&rsquo;t care about it in order to serve it out to other
people who didn&rsquo;t care about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped the old man&rsquo;s rising wrath by a laugh, and
said: &ldquo;Well, <i>you</i> were not taught that way, at any
rate, so you may let your anger run off you a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; said he, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
thank you for correcting my ill-temper: I always fancy myself as
living in any period of which we may be speaking.&nbsp; But,
however, to put it in a cooler way: you expected to see children
thrust into schools when they had reached an age conventionally
supposed to be the due age, whatever their varying faculties and
dispositions might be, and when there, with like disregard to
facts to be subjected to a certain conventional course of
&lsquo;learning.&rsquo;&nbsp; My friend, can&rsquo;t you see that
such a proceeding means ignoring the fact of <i>growth</i>,
bodily and mental?&nbsp; No one could come out of such a mill
uninjured; and those only would avoid being crushed by it who
would have the spirit of rebellion strong in them.&nbsp;
Fortunately most children have had that at all times, or I do not
know that we should ever have reached our present position.&nbsp;
Now you see what it all comes to.&nbsp; In the old times all this
was the result of <i>poverty</i>.&nbsp; In the nineteenth
century, society was so miserably poor, owing to the systematised
robbery on which it was founded, that real education was
impossible for anybody.&nbsp; The whole theory of their so-called
education was that it was necessary to shove a little information
into a child, even if it were by means of torture, and
accompanied by twaddle which it was well known was of no use, or
else he would lack information lifelong: the hurry of poverty
forbade anything else.&nbsp; All that is past; we are no longer
hurried, and the information lies ready to each one&rsquo;s hand
when his own inclinations impel him to seek it.&nbsp; In this as
in other matters we have become wealthy: we can afford to give
ourselves time to grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but suppose the child,
youth, man, never wants the information, never grows in the
direction you might hope him to do: suppose, for instance, he
objects to learning arithmetic or mathematics; you can&rsquo;t
force him when he <i>is</i> grown; can&rsquo;t you force him
while he is growing, and oughtn&rsquo;t you to do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;were you forced to learn
arithmetic and mathematics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how old are you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say fifty-six,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much arithmetic and mathematics do you know
now?&rdquo; quoth the old man, smiling rather mockingly.</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;None whatever, I am sorry to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond laughed quietly, but made no other comment on my
admission, and I dropped the subject of education, perceiving him
to be hopeless on that side.</p>
<p>I thought a little, and said: &ldquo;You were speaking just
now of households: that sounded to me a little like the customs
of past times; I should have thought you would have lived more in
public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phalangsteries, eh?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
we live as we like, and we like to live as a rule with certain
house-mates that we have got used to.&nbsp; Remember, again, that
poverty is extinct, and that the Fourierist phalangsteries and
all their kind, as was but natural at the time, implied nothing
but a refuge from mere destitution.&nbsp; Such a way of life as
that, could only have been conceived of by people surrounded by
the worst form of poverty.&nbsp; But you must understand
therewith, that though separate households are the rule amongst
us, and though they differ in their habits more or less, yet no
door is shut to any good-tempered person who is content to live
as the other house-mates do: only of course it would be
unreasonable for one man to drop into a household and bid the
folk of it to alter their habits to please him, since he can go
elsewhere and live as he pleases.&nbsp; However, I need not say
much about all this, as you are going up the river with Dick, and
will find out for yourself by experience how these matters are
managed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause, I said: &ldquo;Your big towns, now; how about
them?&nbsp; London, which&mdash;which I have read about as the
modern Babylon of civilization, seems to have
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said old Hammond, &ldquo;perhaps
after all it is more like ancient Babylon now than the
&lsquo;modern Babylon&rsquo; of the nineteenth century was.&nbsp;
But let that pass.&nbsp; After all, there is a good deal of
population in places between here and Hammersmith; nor have you
seen the most populous part of the town yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how is it towards
the east?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;Time was when if you mounted a good horse and
rode straight away from my door here at a round trot for an hour
and a half; you would still be in the thick of London, and the
greater part of that would be &lsquo;slums,&rsquo; as they were
called; that is to say, places of torture for innocent men and
women; or worse, stews for rearing and breeding men and women in
such degradation that that torture should seem to them mere
ordinary and natural life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; I said, rather
impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was what was; tell me something of
what is.&nbsp; Is any of that left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not an inch,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but some memory of
it abides with us, and I am glad of it.&nbsp; Once a year, on
May-day, we hold a solemn feast in those easterly communes of
London to commemorate The Clearing of Misery, as it is
called.&nbsp; On that day we have music and dancing, and merry
games and happy feasting on the site of some of the worst of the
old slums, the traditional memory of which we have kept.&nbsp; On
that occasion the custom is for the prettiest girls to sing some
of the old revolutionary songs, and those which were the groans
of the discontent, once so hopeless, on the very spots where
those terrible crimes of class-murder were committed day by day
for so many years.&nbsp; To a man like me, who have studied the
past so diligently, it is a curious and touching sight to see
some beautiful girl, daintily clad, and crowned with flowers from
the neighbouring meadows, standing amongst the happy people, on
some mound where of old time stood the wretched apology for a
house, a den in which men and women lived packed amongst the
filth like pilchards in a cask; lived in such a way that they
could only have endured it, as I said just now, by being degraded
out of humanity&mdash;to hear the terrible words of threatening
and lamentation coming from her sweet and beautiful lips, and she
unconscious of their real meaning: to hear her, for instance,
singing Hood&rsquo;s Song of the Shirt, and to think that all the
time she does not understand what it is all about&mdash;a tragedy
grown inconceivable to her and her listeners.&nbsp; Think of
that, if you can, and of how glorious life is grown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is difficult for me to
think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I sat watching how his eyes glittered, and how the fresh
life seemed to glow in his face, and I wondered how at his age he
should think of the happiness of the world, or indeed anything
but his coming dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me in detail,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what lies east
of Bloomsbury now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;There are but few houses between this and the
outer part of the old city; but in the city we have a
thickly-dwelling population.&nbsp; Our forefathers, in the first
clearing of the slums, were not in a hurry to pull down the
houses in what was called at the end of the nineteenth century
the business quarter of the town, and what later got to be known
as the Swindling Kens.&nbsp; You see, these houses, though they
stood hideously thick on the ground, were roomy and fairly solid
in building, and clean, because they were not used for living in,
but as mere gambling booths; so the poor people from the cleared
slums took them for lodgings and dwelt there, till the folk of
those days had time to think of something better for them; so the
buildings were pulled down so gradually that people got used to
living thicker on the ground there than in most places; therefore
it remains the most populous part of London, or perhaps of all
these islands.&nbsp; But it is very pleasant there, partly
because of the splendour of the architecture, which goes further
than what you will see elsewhere.&nbsp; However, this crowding,
if it may be called so, does not go further than a street called
Aldgate, a name which perhaps you may have heard of.&nbsp; Beyond
that the houses are scattered wide about the meadows there, which
are very beautiful, especially when you get on to the lovely
river Lea (where old Isaak Walton used to fish, you know) about
the places called Stratford and Old Ford, names which of course
you will not have heard of, though the Romans were busy there
once upon a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not heard of them! thought I to myself.&nbsp; How strange!
that I who had seen the very last remnant of the pleasantness of
the meadows by the Lea destroyed, should have heard them spoken
of with pleasantness come back to them in full measure.</p>
<p>Hammond went on: &ldquo;When you get down to the Thames side
you come on the Docks, which are works of the nineteenth century,
and are still in use, although not so thronged as they once were,
since we discourage centralisation all we can, and we have long
ago dropped the pretension to be the market of the world.&nbsp;
About these Docks are a good few houses, which, however, are not
inhabited by many people permanently; I mean, those who use them
come and go a good deal, the place being too low and marshy for
pleasant dwelling.&nbsp; Past the Docks eastward and landward it
is all flat pasture, once marsh, except for a few gardens, and
there are very few permanent dwellings there: scarcely anything
but a few sheds, and cots for the men who come to look after the
great herds of cattle pasturing there.&nbsp; But however, what
with the beasts and the men, and the scattered red-tiled roofs
and the big hayricks, it does not make a bad holiday to get a
quiet pony and ride about there on a sunny afternoon of autumn,
and look over the river and the craft passing up and down, and on
to Shooters&rsquo; Hill and the Kentish uplands, and then turn
round to the wide green sea of the Essex marsh-land, with the
great domed line of the sky, and the sun shining down in one
flood of peaceful light over the long distance.&nbsp; There is a
place called Canning&rsquo;s Town, and further out, Silvertown,
where the pleasant meadows are at their pleasantest: doubtless
they were once slums, and wretched enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The names grated on my ear, but I could not explain why to
him.&nbsp; So I said: &ldquo;And south of the river, what is it
like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;You would find it much the same as the land
about Hammersmith.&nbsp; North, again, the land runs up high, and
there is an agreeable and well-built town called Hampstead, which
fitly ends London on that side.&nbsp; It looks down on the
north-western end of the forest you passed through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;So much for what was once
London,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now tell me about the other
towns of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;As to the big murky places which were once, as
we know, the centres of manufacture, they have, like the brick
and mortar desert of London, disappeared; only, since they were
centres of nothing but &lsquo;manufacture,&rsquo; and served no
purpose but that of the gambling market, they have left less
signs of their existence than London.&nbsp; Of course, the great
change in the use of mechanical force made this an easy matter,
and some approach to their break-up as centres would probably
have taken place, even if we had not changed our habits so much:
but they being such as they were, no sacrifice would have seemed
too great a price to pay for getting rid of the
&lsquo;manufacturing districts,&rsquo; as they used to be
called.&nbsp; For the rest, whatever coal or mineral we need is
brought to grass and sent whither it is needed with as little as
possible of dirt, confusion, and the distressing of quiet
people&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; One is tempted to believe from what
one has read of the condition of those districts in the
nineteenth century, that those who had them under their power
worried, befouled, and degraded men out of malice prepense: but
it was not so; like the mis-education of which we were talking
just now, it came of their dreadful poverty.&nbsp; They were
obliged to put up with everything, and even pretend that they
liked it; whereas we can now deal with things reasonably, and
refuse to be saddled with what we do not want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I confess I was not sorry to cut short with a question his
glorifications of the age he lived in.&nbsp; Said I: &ldquo;How
about the smaller towns?&nbsp; I suppose you have swept those
away entirely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it hasn&rsquo;t gone
that way.&nbsp; On the contrary, there has been but little
clearance, though much rebuilding, in the smaller towns.&nbsp;
Their suburbs, indeed, when they had any, have melted away into
the general country, and space and elbow-room has been got in
their centres: but there are the towns still with their streets
and squares and market-places; so that it is by means of these
smaller towns that we of to-day can get some kind of idea of what
the towns of the older world were like;&mdash;I mean to say at
their best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take Oxford, for instance,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I suppose Oxford was
beautiful even in the nineteenth century.&nbsp; At present it has
the great interest of still preserving a great mass of
pre-commercial building, and is a very beautiful place, yet there
are many towns which have become scarcely less
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;In passing, may I ask if it is still a place of
learning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still?&rdquo; said he, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, it
has reverted to some of its best traditions; so you may imagine
how far it is from its nineteenth-century position.&nbsp; It is
real learning, knowledge cultivated for its own sake&mdash;the
Art of Knowledge, in short&mdash;which is followed there, not the
Commercial learning of the past.&nbsp; Though perhaps you do not
know that in the nineteenth century Oxford and its less
interesting sister Cambridge became definitely commercial.&nbsp;
They (and especially Oxford) were the breeding places of a
peculiar class of parasites, who called themselves cultivated
people; they were indeed cynical enough, as the so-called
educated classes of the day generally were; but they affected an
exaggeration of cynicism in order that they might be thought
knowing and worldly-wise.&nbsp; The rich middle classes (they had
no relation with the working classes) treated them with the kind
of contemptuous toleration with which a medi&aelig;val baron
treated his jester; though it must be said that they were by no
means so pleasant as the old jesters were, being, in fact,
<i>the</i> bores of society.&nbsp; They were laughed at,
despised&mdash;and paid.&nbsp; Which last was what they aimed
at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dear me! thought I, how apt history is to reverse contemporary
judgments.&nbsp; Surely only the worst of them were as bad as
that.&nbsp; But I must admit that they were mostly prigs, and
that they <i>were</i> commercial.&nbsp; I said aloud, though more
to myself than to Hammond, &ldquo;Well, how could they be better
than the age that made them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but their pretensions were
higher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they?&rdquo; said I, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You drive me from corner to corner,&rdquo; said he,
smiling in turn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me say at least that they were
a poor sequence to the aspirations of Oxford of &lsquo;the
barbarous Middle Ages.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will do,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also,&rdquo; said Hammond, &ldquo;what I have been
saying of them is true in the main.&nbsp; But ask on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;We have heard about London and the
manufacturing districts and the ordinary towns: how about the
villages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Hammond: &ldquo;You must know that toward the end of the
nineteenth century the villages were almost destroyed, unless
where they became mere adjuncts to the manufacturing districts,
or formed a sort of minor manufacturing districts
themselves.&nbsp; Houses were allowed to fall into decay and
actual ruin; trees were cut down for the sake of the few
shillings which the poor sticks would fetch; the building became
inexpressibly mean and hideous.&nbsp; Labour was scarce; but
wages fell nevertheless.&nbsp; All the small country arts of life
which once added to the little pleasures of country people were
lost.&nbsp; The country produce which passed through the hands of
the husbandmen never got so far as their mouths.&nbsp; Incredible
shabbiness and niggardly pinching reigned over the fields and
acres which, in spite of the rude and careless husbandry of the
times, were so kind and bountiful.&nbsp; Had you any inkling of
all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard that it was so,&rdquo; said I &ldquo;but
what followed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The change,&rdquo; said Hammond, &ldquo;which in these
matters took place very early in our epoch, was most strangely
rapid.&nbsp; People flocked into the country villages, and, so to
say, flung themselves upon the freed land like a wild beast upon
his prey; and in a very little time the villages of England were
more populous than they had been since the fourteenth century,
and were still growing fast.&nbsp; Of course, this invasion of
the country was awkward to deal with, and would have created much
misery, if the folk had still been under the bondage of class
monopoly.&nbsp; But as it was, things soon righted
themselves.&nbsp; People found out what they were fit for, and
gave up attempting to push themselves into occupations in which
they must needs fail.&nbsp; The town invaded the country; but the
invaders, like the warlike invaders of early days, yielded to the
influence of their surroundings, and became country people; and
in their turn, as they became more numerous than the townsmen,
influenced them also; so that the difference between town and
country grew less and less; and it was indeed this world of the
country vivified by the thought and briskness of town-bred folk
which has produced that happy and leisurely but eager life of
which you have had a first taste.&nbsp; Again I say, many
blunders were made, but we have had time to set them right.&nbsp;
Much was left for the men of my earlier life to deal with.&nbsp;
The crude ideas of the first half of the twentieth century, when
men were still oppressed by the fear of poverty, and did not look
enough to the present pleasure of ordinary daily life, spoilt a
great deal of what the commercial age had left us of external
beauty: and I admit that it was but slowly that men recovered
from the injuries that they inflicted on themselves even after
they became free.&nbsp; But slowly as the recovery came, it
<i>did</i> come; and the more you see of us, the clearer it will
be to you that we are happy.&nbsp; That we live amidst beauty
without any fear of becoming effeminate; that we have plenty to
do, and on the whole enjoy doing it.&nbsp; What more can we ask
of life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, as if he were seeking for words with which to
express his thought.&nbsp; Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is how we stand.&nbsp; England was once a country
of clearings amongst the woods and wastes, with a few towns
interspersed, which were fortresses for the feudal army, markets
for the folk, gathering places for the craftsmen.&nbsp; It then
became a country of huge and foul workshops and fouler
gambling-dens, surrounded by an ill-kept, poverty-stricken farm,
pillaged by the masters of the workshops.&nbsp; It is now a
garden, where nothing is wasted and nothing is spoilt, with the
necessary dwellings, sheds, and workshops scattered up and down
the country, all trim and neat and pretty.&nbsp; For, indeed, we
should be too much ashamed of ourselves if we allowed the making
of goods, even on a large scale, to carry with it the appearance,
even, of desolation and misery.&nbsp; Why, my friend, those
housewives we were talking of just now would teach us better than
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;This side of your change is certainly for the
better.&nbsp; But though I shall soon see some of these villages,
tell me in a word or two what they are like, just to prepare
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have seen a
tolerable picture of these villages as they were before the end
of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; Such things exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen several of such pictures,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hammond, &ldquo;our villages are
something like the best of such places, with the church or
mote-house of the neighbours for their chief building.&nbsp; Only
note that there are no tokens of poverty about them: no
tumble-down picturesque; which, to tell you the truth, the artist
usually availed himself of to veil his incapacity for drawing
architecture.&nbsp; Such things do not please us, even when they
indicate no misery.&nbsp; Like the medi&aelig;vals, we like
everything trim and clean, and orderly and bright; as people
always do when they have any sense of architectural power;
because then they know that they can have what they want, and
they won&rsquo;t stand any nonsense from Nature in their dealings
with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides the villages, are there any scattered country
houses?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, plenty,&rdquo; said Hammond; &ldquo;in fact,
except in the wastes and forests and amongst the sand-hills (like
Hindhead in Surrey), it is not easy to be out of sight of a
house; and where the houses are thinly scattered they run large,
and are more like the old colleges than ordinary houses as they
used to be.&nbsp; That is done for the sake of society, for a
good many people can dwell in such houses, as the country
dwellers are not necessarily husbandmen; though they almost all
help in such work at times.&nbsp; The life that goes on in these
big dwellings in the country is very pleasant, especially as some
of the most studious men of our time live in them, and altogether
there is a great variety of mind and mood to be found in them
which brightens and quickens the society there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am rather surprised,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;by all
this, for it seems to me that after all the country must be
tolerably populous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the population is
pretty much the same as it was at the end of the nineteenth
century; we have spread it, that is all.&nbsp; Of course, also,
we have helped to populate other countries&mdash;where we were
wanted and were called for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;One thing, it seems to me, does not go with
your word of &lsquo;garden&rsquo; for the country.&nbsp; You have
spoken of wastes and forests, and I myself have seen the
beginning of your Middlesex and Essex forest.&nbsp; Why do you
keep such things in a garden? and isn&rsquo;t it very wasteful to
do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we like these pieces
of wild nature, and can afford them, so we have them; let alone
that as to the forests, we need a great deal of timber, and
suppose that our sons and sons&rsquo; sons will do the
like.&nbsp; As to the land being a garden, I have heard that they
used to have shrubberies and rockeries in gardens once; and
though I might not like the artificial ones, I assure you that
some of the natural rockeries of our garden are worth
seeing.&nbsp; Go north this summer and look at the Cumberland and
Westmoreland ones,&mdash;where, by the way, you will see some
sheep-feeding, so that they are not so wasteful as you think; not
so wasteful as forcing-grounds for fruit out of season, <i>I</i>
think.&nbsp; Go and have a look at the sheep-walks high up the
slopes between Ingleborough and Pen-y-gwent, and tell me if you
think we <i>waste</i> the land there by not covering it with
factories for making things that nobody wants, which was the
chief business of the nineteenth century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try to go there,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take much trying,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI: CONCERNING GOVERNMENT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have come to the point of
asking questions which I suppose will be dry for you to answer
and difficult for you to explain; but I have foreseen for some
time past that I must ask them, will I &rsquo;nill I.&nbsp; What
kind of a government have you?&nbsp; Has republicanism finally
triumphed? or have you come to a mere dictatorship, which some
persons in the nineteenth century used to prophesy as the
ultimate outcome of democracy?&nbsp; Indeed, this last question
does not seem so very unreasonable, since you have turned your
Parliament House into a dung-market.&nbsp; Or where do you house
your present Parliament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man answered my smile with a hearty laugh, and said:
&ldquo;Well, well, dung is not the worst kind of corruption;
fertility may come of that, whereas mere dearth came from the
other kind, of which those walls once held the great
supporters.&nbsp; Now, dear guest, let me tell you that our
present parliament would be hard to house in one place, because
the whole people is our parliament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must
now shock you by telling you that we have no longer anything
which you, a native of another planet, would call a
government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so much shocked as you might think,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;as I know something about governments.&nbsp; But
tell me, how do you manage, and how have you come to this state
of things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;It is true that we have to make some
arrangements about our affairs, concerning which you can ask
presently; and it is also true that everybody does not always
agree with the details of these arrangements; but, further, it is
true that a man no more needs an elaborate system of government,
with its army, navy, and police, to force him to give way to the
will of the majority of his <i>equals</i>, than he wants a
similar machinery to make him understand that his head and a
stone wall cannot occupy the same space at the same moment.&nbsp;
Do you want further explanation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I do,&rdquo; quoth I.</p>
<p>Old Hammond settled himself in his chair with a look of
enjoyment which rather alarmed me, and made me dread a scientific
disquisition: so I sighed and abided.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know pretty well what the process of
government was in the bad old times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am supposed to know,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>(Hammond)&nbsp; What was the government of those days?&nbsp;
Was it really the Parliament or any part of it?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; No.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; Was not the Parliament on the one side a kind of
watch-committee sitting to see that the interests of the Upper
Classes took no hurt; and on the other side a sort of blind to
delude the people into supposing that they had some share in the
management of their own affairs?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; History seems to show us this.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; To what extent did the people manage their own
affairs?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; I judge from what I have heard that sometimes they
forced the Parliament to make a law to legalise some alteration
which had already taken place.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; Anything else?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; As I am informed, if the people
made any attempt to deal with the <i>cause</i> of their
grievances, the law stepped in and said, this is sedition,
revolt, or what not, and slew or tortured the ringleaders of such
attempts.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; If Parliament was not the government then, nor the
people either, what was the government?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; Can you tell me?</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; I think we shall not be far wrong if we say that
government was the Law-Courts, backed up by the executive, which
handled the brute force that the deluded people allowed them to
use for their own purposes; I mean the army, navy, and
police.</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; Reasonable men must needs think you are right.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; Now as to those Law-Courts.&nbsp; Were they places
of fair dealing according to the ideas of the day?&nbsp; Had a
poor man a good chance of defending his property and person in
them?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; It is a commonplace that even rich men looked upon a
law-suit as a dire misfortune, even if they gained the case; and
as for a poor one&mdash;why, it was considered a miracle of
justice and beneficence if a poor man who had once got into the
clutches of the law escaped prison or utter ruin.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; It seems, then, my son, that the government by
law-courts and police, which was the real government of the
nineteenth century, was not a great success even to the people of
that day, living under a class system which proclaimed inequality
and poverty as the law of God and the bond which held the world
together.</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; So it seems, indeed.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; And now that all this is changed, and the
&ldquo;rights of property,&rdquo; which mean the clenching the
fist on a piece of goods and crying out to the neighbours, You
shan&rsquo;t have this!&mdash;now that all this has disappeared
so utterly that it is no longer possible even to jest upon its
absurdity, is such a Government possible?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; It is impossible.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; Yes, happily.&nbsp; But for what other purpose than
the protection of the rich from the poor, the strong from the
weak, did this Government exist?</p>
<p>(I.)&nbsp; I have heard that it was said that their office was
to defend their own citizens against attack from other
countries.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; It was said; but was anyone expected to believe
this?&nbsp; For instance, did the English Government defend the
English citizen against the French?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; So it was said.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; Then if the French had invaded England and
conquered it, they would not have allowed the English workmen to
live well?</p>
<p>(I, laughing)&nbsp; As far as I can make out, the English
masters of the English workmen saw to that: they took from their
workmen as much of their livelihood as they dared, because they
wanted it for themselves.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; But if the French had conquered, would they not
have taken more still from the English workmen?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; I do not think so; for in that case the English
workmen would have died of starvation; and then the French
conquest would have ruined the French, just as if the English
horses and cattle had died of under-feeding.&nbsp; So that after
all, the English <i>workmen</i> would have been no worse off for
the conquest: their French Masters could have got no more from
them than their English masters did.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; This is true; and we may admit that the pretensions
of the government to defend the poor (<i>i.e.</i>, the useful)
people against other countries come to nothing.&nbsp; But that is
but natural; for we have seen already that it was the function of
government to protect the rich against the poor.&nbsp; But did
not the government defend its rich men against other nations?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; I do not remember to have heard that the rich needed
defence; because it is said that even when two nations were at
war, the rich men of each nation gambled with each other pretty
much as usual, and even sold each other weapons wherewith to kill
their own countrymen.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; In short, it comes to this, that whereas the
so-called government of protection of property by means of the
law-courts meant destruction of wealth, this defence of the
citizens of one country against those of another country by means
of war or the threat of war meant pretty much the same thing.</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; I cannot deny it.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; Therefore the government really existed for the
destruction of wealth?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; So it seems.&nbsp; And yet&mdash;</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; Yet what?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; There were many rich people in those times.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; You see the consequences of that fact?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; I think I do.&nbsp; But tell me out what they
were.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; If the government habitually destroyed wealth, the
country must have been poor?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; Yes, certainly.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; Yet amidst this poverty the persons for the sake of
whom the government existed insisted on being rich whatever might
happen?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; So it was.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; What must happen if in a poor country some people
insist on being rich at the expense of the others?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; Unutterable poverty for the others.&nbsp; All this
misery, then, was caused by the destructive government of which
we have been speaking?</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; Nay, it would be incorrect to say so.&nbsp; The
government itself was but the necessary result of the careless,
aimless tyranny of the times; it was but the machinery of
tyranny.&nbsp; Now tyranny has come to an end, and we no longer
need such machinery; we could not possibly use it since we are
free.&nbsp; Therefore in your sense of the word we have no
government.&nbsp; Do you understand this now?</p>
<p>(I)&nbsp; Yes, I do.&nbsp; But I will ask you some more
questions as to how you as free men manage your affairs.</p>
<p>(H.)&nbsp; With all my heart.&nbsp; Ask away.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII: CONCERNING THE ARRANGEMENT OF LIFE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;about those
&lsquo;arrangements&rsquo; which you spoke of as taking the place
of government, could you give me any account of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neighbour,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;although we have
simplified our lives a great deal from what they were, and have
got rid of many conventionalities and many sham wants, which used
to give our forefathers much trouble, yet our life is too complex
for me to tell you in detail by means of words how it is
arranged; you must find that out by living amongst us.&nbsp; It
is true that I can better tell you what we don&rsquo;t do, than
what we do do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the way to put it,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;We
have been living for a hundred and fifty years, at least, more or
less in our present manner, and a tradition or habit of life has
been growing on us; and that habit has become a habit of acting
on the whole for the best.&nbsp; It is easy for us to live
without robbing each other.&nbsp; It would be possible for us to
contend with and rob each other, but it would be harder for us
than refraining from strife and robbery.&nbsp; That is in short
the foundation of our life and our happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas in the old days,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it was
very hard to live without strife and robbery.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what you mean, isn&rsquo;t it, by giving me the negative side of
your good conditions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was so hard, that those
who habitually acted fairly to their neighbours were celebrated
as saints and heroes, and were looked up to with the greatest
reverence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While they were alive?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;after they were
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as to these days,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t mean to tell me that no one ever transgresses this
habit of good fellowship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Hammond, &ldquo;but when the
transgressions occur, everybody, transgressors and all, know them
for what they are; the errors of friends, not the habitual
actions of persons driven into enmity against society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you mean that you have no
&lsquo;criminal&rsquo; classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could we have them,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since
there is no rich class to breed enemies against the state by
means of the injustice of the state?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;I thought that I understood from something that
fell from you a little while ago that you had abolished civil
law.&nbsp; Is that so, literally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It abolished itself, my friend,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As I said before, the civil law-courts were upheld for the
defence of private property; for nobody ever pretended that it
was possible to make people act fairly to each other by means of
brute force.&nbsp; Well, private property being abolished, all
the laws and all the legal &lsquo;crimes&rsquo; which it had
manufactured of course came to an end.&nbsp; Thou shalt not
steal, had to be translated into, Thou shalt work in order to
live happily.&nbsp; Is there any need to enforce that commandment
by violence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that is understood, and I
agree with it; but how about crimes of violence? would not their
occurrence (and you admit that they occur) make criminal law
necessary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;In your sense of the word, we have no criminal
law either.&nbsp; Let us look at the matter closer, and see
whence crimes of violence spring.&nbsp; By far the greater part
of these in past days were the result of the laws of private
property, which forbade the satisfaction of their natural desires
to all but a privileged few, and of the general visible coercion
which came of those laws.&nbsp; All that cause of violent crime
is gone.&nbsp; Again, many violent acts came from the artificial
perversion of the sexual passions, which caused overweening
jealousy and the like miseries.&nbsp; Now, when you look
carefully into these, you will find that what lay at the bottom
of them was mostly the idea (a law-made idea) of the woman being
the property of the man, whether he were husband, father,
brother, or what not.&nbsp; That idea has of course vanished with
private property, as well as certain follies about the
&lsquo;ruin&rsquo; of women for following their natural desires
in an illegal way, which of course was a convention caused by the
laws of private property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another cognate cause of crimes of violence was the
family tyranny, which was the subject of so many novels and
stories of the past, and which once more was the result of
private property.&nbsp; Of course that is all ended, since
families are held together by no bond of coercion, legal or
social, but by mutual liking and affection, and everybody is free
to come or go as he or she pleases.&nbsp; Furthermore, our
standards of honour and public estimation are very different from
the old ones; success in besting our neighbours is a road to
renown now closed, let us hope for ever.&nbsp; Each man is free
to exercise his special faculty to the utmost, and every one
encourages him in so doing.&nbsp; So that we have got rid of the
scowling envy, coupled by the poets with hatred, and surely with
good reason; heaps of unhappiness and ill-blood were caused by
it, which with irritable and passionate men&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
energetic and active men&mdash;often led to violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed, and said: &ldquo;So that you now withdraw your
admission, and say that there is no violence amongst
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I withdraw nothing; as I
told you, such things will happen.&nbsp; Hot blood will err
sometimes.&nbsp; A man may strike another, and the stricken
strike back again, and the result be a homicide, to put it at the
worst.&nbsp; But what then?&nbsp; Shall we the neighbours make it
worse still?&nbsp; Shall we think so poorly of each other as to
suppose that the slain man calls on us to revenge him, when we
know that if he had been maimed, he would, when in cold blood and
able to weigh all the circumstances, have forgiven his
manner?&nbsp; Or will the death of the slayer bring the slain man
to life again and cure the unhappiness his loss has
caused?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but consider, must not the
safety of society be safeguarded by some punishment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, neighbour!&rdquo; said the old man, with some
exultation &ldquo;You have hit the mark.&nbsp; That
<i>punishment</i> of which men used to talk so wisely and act so
foolishly, what was it but the expression of their fear?&nbsp;
And they had need to fear, since they&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the
rulers of society&mdash;were dwelling like an armed band in a
hostile country.&nbsp; But we who live amongst our friends need
neither fear nor punish.&nbsp; Surely if we, in dread of an
occasional rare homicide, an occasional rough blow, were solemnly
and legally to commit homicide and violence, we could only be a
society of ferocious cowards.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think so,
neighbour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, when I come to think of it from that
side,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you must understand,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;that when any violence is committed, we expect the
transgressor to make any atonement possible to him, and he
himself expects it.&nbsp; But again, think if the destruction or
serious injury of a man momentarily overcome by wrath or folly
can be any atonement to the commonwealth?&nbsp; Surely it can
only be an additional injury to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;But suppose the man has a habit of
violence,&mdash;kills a man a year, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a thing is unknown,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In a society where there is no punishment to evade, no law
to triumph over, remorse will certainly follow
transgression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lesser outbreaks of violence,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;how do you deal with them? for hitherto we have been
talking of great tragedies, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Hammond: &ldquo;If the ill-doer is not sick or mad (in
which case he must be restrained till his sickness or madness is
cured) it is clear that grief and humiliation must follow the
ill-deed; and society in general will make that pretty clear to
the ill-doer if he should chance to be dull to it; and again,
some kind of atonement will follow,&mdash;at the least, an open
acknowledgement of the grief and humiliation.&nbsp; Is it so hard
to say, I ask your pardon, neighbour?&mdash;Well, sometimes it is
hard&mdash;and let it be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that enough?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and moreover it is all that
we <i>can</i> do.&nbsp; If in addition we torture the man, we
turn his grief into anger, and the humiliation he would otherwise
feel for <i>his</i> wrong-doing is swallowed up by a hope of
revenge for <i>our</i> wrong-doing to him.&nbsp; He has paid the
legal penalty, and can &lsquo;go and sin again&rsquo; with
comfort.&nbsp; Shall we commit such a folly, then?&nbsp; Remember
Jesus had got the legal penalty remitted before he said &lsquo;Go
and sin no more.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let alone that in a society of
equals you will not find any one to play the part of torturer or
jailer, though many to act as nurse or doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you consider crime a mere
spasmodic disease, which requires no body of criminal law to deal
with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty much so,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and since, as I
have told you, we are a healthy people generally, so we are not
likely to be much troubled with <i>this</i> disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have no civil law, and no criminal law.&nbsp;
But have you no laws of the market, so to say&mdash;no regulation
for the exchange of wares? for you must exchange, even if you
have no property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;We have no obvious individual exchange, as you
saw this morning when you went a-shopping; but of course there
are regulations of the markets, varying according to the
circumstances and guided by general custom.&nbsp; But as these
are matters of general assent, which nobody dreams of objecting
to, so also we have made no provision for enforcing them:
therefore I don&rsquo;t call them laws.&nbsp; In law, whether it
be criminal or civil, execution always follows judgment, and
someone must suffer.&nbsp; When you see the judge on his bench,
you see through him, as clearly as if he were made of glass, the
policeman to emprison, and the soldier to slay some actual living
person.&nbsp; Such follies would make an agreeable market,
wouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that means turning the
market into a mere battle-field, in which many people must suffer
as much as in the battle-field of bullet and bayonet.&nbsp; And
from what I have seen I should suppose that your marketing, great
and little, is carried on in a way that makes it a pleasant
occupation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, neighbour,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Although there are so many, indeed by far the greater
number amongst us, who would be unhappy if they were not engaged
in actually making things, and things which turn out beautiful
under their hands,&mdash;there are many, like the housekeepers I
was speaking of, whose delight is in administration and
organisation, to use long-tailed words; I mean people who like
keeping things together, avoiding waste, seeing that nothing
sticks fast uselessly.&nbsp; Such people are thoroughly happy in
their business, all the more as they are dealing with actual
facts, and not merely passing counters round to see what share
they shall have in the privileged taxation of useful people,
which was the business of the commercial folk in past days.&nbsp;
Well, what are you going to ask me next?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII: CONCERNING POLITICS</h2>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;How do you manage with politics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Hammond, smiling: &ldquo;I am glad that it is of
<i>me</i> that you ask that question; I do believe that anybody
else would make you explain yourself, or try to do so, till you
were sickened of asking questions.&nbsp; Indeed, I believe I am
the only man in England who would know what you mean; and since I
know, I will answer your question briefly by saying that we are
very well off as to politics,&mdash;because we have none.&nbsp;
If ever you make a book out of this conversation, put this in a
chapter by itself, after the model of old Horrebow&rsquo;s Snakes
in Iceland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV: HOW MATTERS ARE MANAGED</h2>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;How about your relations with foreign
nations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not affect not to know what you mean,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;but I will tell you at once that the whole system
of rival and contending nations which played so great a part in
the &lsquo;government&rsquo; of the world of civilisation has
disappeared along with the inequality betwixt man and man in
society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does not that make the world duller?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The obliteration of national variety,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he said, somewhat snappishly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cross the water and see.&nbsp; You will find plenty of
variety: the landscape, the building, the diet, the amusements,
all various.&nbsp; The men and women varying in looks as well as
in habits of thought; the costume far more various than in the
commercial period.&nbsp; How should it add to the variety or
dispel the dulness, to coerce certain families or tribes, often
heterogeneous and jarring with one another, into certain
artificial and mechanical groups, and call them nations, and
stimulate their patriotism&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, their foolish and
envious prejudices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Hammond cheerily;
&ldquo;you can easily understand that now we are freed from this
folly it is obvious to us that by means of this very diversity
the different strains of blood in the world can be serviceable
and pleasant to each other, without in the least wanting to rob
each other: we are all bent on the same enterprise, making the
most of our lives.&nbsp; And I must tell you whatever quarrels or
misunderstandings arise, they very seldom take place between
people of different race; and consequently since there is less
unreason in them, they are the more readily appeased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but as to those matters of
politics; as to general differences of opinion in one and the
same community.&nbsp; Do you assert that there are
none?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; said he, somewhat snappishly;
&ldquo;but I do say that differences of opinion about real solid
things need not, and with us do not, crystallise people into
parties permanently hostile to one another, with different
theories as to the build of the universe and the progress of
time.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that what politics used to
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am not so sure
of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;I take, you, neighbour; they only
<i>pretended</i> to this serious difference of opinion; for if it
had existed they could not have dealt together in the ordinary
business of life; couldn&rsquo;t have eaten together, bought and
sold together, gambled together, cheated other people together,
but must have fought whenever they met: which would not have
suited them at all.&nbsp; The game of the masters of politics was
to cajole or force the public to pay the expense of a luxurious
life and exciting amusement for a few cliques of ambitious
persons: and the <i>pretence</i> of serious difference of
opinion, belied by every action of their lives, was quite good
enough for that.&nbsp; What has all that got to do with
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;Why, nothing, I should hope.&nbsp; But I
fear&mdash;In short, I have been told that political strife was a
necessary result of human nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human nature!&rdquo; cried the old boy, impetuously;
&ldquo;what human nature?&nbsp; The human nature of paupers, of
slaves, of slave-holders, or the human nature of wealthy
freemen?&nbsp; Which?&nbsp; Come, tell me that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I suppose there would be a
difference according to circumstances in people&rsquo;s action
about these matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so, indeed,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;At all events, experience shows that it is so.&nbsp;
Amongst us, our differences concern matters of business, and
passing events as to them, and could not divide men
permanently.&nbsp; As a rule, the immediate outcome shows which
opinion on a given subject is the right one; it is a matter of
fact, not of speculation.&nbsp; For instance, it is clearly not
easy to knock up a political party on the question as to whether
haymaking in such and such a country-side shall begin this week
or next, when all men agree that it must at latest begin the week
after next, and when any man can go down into the fields himself
and see whether the seeds are ripe enough for the
cutting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;And you settle these differences, great and
small, by the will of the majority, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;how else could we
settle them?&nbsp; You see in matters which are merely personal
which do not affect the welfare of the community&mdash;how a man
shall dress, what he shall eat and drink, what he shall write and
read, and so forth&mdash;there can be no difference of opinion,
and everybody does as he pleases.&nbsp; But when the matter is of
common interest to the whole community, and the doing or not
doing something affects everybody, the majority must have their
way; unless the minority were to take up arms and show by force
that they were the effective or real majority; which, however, in
a society of men who are free and equal is little likely to
happen; because in such a community the apparent majority
<i>is</i> the real majority, and the others, as I have hinted
before, know that too well to obstruct from mere pigheadedness;
especially as they have had plenty of opportunity of putting
forward their side of the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that managed?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us take one of our
units of management, a commune, or a ward, or a parish (for we
have all three names, indicating little real distinction between
them now, though time was there was a good deal).&nbsp; In such a
district, as you would call it, some neighbours think that
something ought to be done or undone: a new town-hall built; a
clearance of inconvenient houses; or say a stone bridge
substituted for some ugly old iron one,&mdash;there you have
undoing and doing in one.&nbsp; Well, at the next ordinary
meeting of the neighbours, or Mote, as we call it, according to
the ancient tongue of the times before bureaucracy, a neighbour
proposes the change, and of course, if everybody agrees, there is
an end of discussion, except about details.&nbsp; Equally, if no
one backs the proposer,&mdash;&lsquo;seconds him,&rsquo; it used
to be called&mdash;the matter drops for the time being; a thing
not likely to happen amongst reasonable men, however, as the
proposer is sure to have talked it over with others before the
Mote.&nbsp; But supposing the affair proposed and seconded, if a
few of the neighbours disagree to it, if they think that the
beastly iron bridge will serve a little longer and they
don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with building a new one just
then, they don&rsquo;t count heads that time, but put off the
formal discussion to the next Mote; and meantime arguments
<i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> are flying about, and some get printed,
so that everybody knows what is going on; and when the Mote comes
together again there is a regular discussion and at last a vote
by show of hands.&nbsp; If the division is a close one, the
question is again put off for further discussion; if the division
is a wide one, the minority are asked if they will yield to the
more general opinion, which they often, nay, most commonly
do.&nbsp; If they refuse, the question is debated a third time,
when, if the minority has not perceptibly grown, they always give
way; though I believe there is some half-forgotten rule by which
they might still carry it on further; but I say, what always
happens is that they are convinced, not perhaps that their view
is the wrong one, but they cannot persuade or force the community
to adopt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but what happens if
the divisions are still narrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;As a matter of principle and according to the
rule of such cases, the question must then lapse, and the
majority, if so narrow, has to submit to sitting down under the
<i>status quo</i>.&nbsp; But I must tell you that in point of
fact the minority very seldom enforces this rule, but generally
yields in a friendly manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you know,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that there is
something in all this very like democracy; and I thought that
democracy was considered to be in a moribund condition many, many
years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old boy&rsquo;s eyes twinkled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I grant you
that our methods have that drawback.&nbsp; But what is to be
done?&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t get <i>anyone</i> amongst us to
complain of his not always having his own way in the teeth of the
community, when it is clear that <i>everybody</i> cannot have
that indulgence.&nbsp; What is to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;The only alternatives to our method that I can
conceive of are these.&nbsp; First, that we should choose out, or
breed, a class of superior persons capable of judging on all
matters without consulting the neighbours; that, in short, we
should get for ourselves what used to be called an aristocracy of
intellect; or, secondly, that for the purpose of safe-guarding
the freedom of the individual will, we should revert to a system
of private property again, and have slaves and slave-holders once
more.&nbsp; What do you think of those two expedients?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there is a third
possibility&mdash;to wit, that every man should be quite
independent of every other, and that thus the tyranny of society
should be abolished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked hard at me for a second or two, and then burst out
laughing very heartily; and I confess that I joined him.&nbsp;
When he recovered himself he nodded at me, and said: &ldquo;Yes,
yes, I quite agree with you&mdash;and so we all do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and besides, it does not
press hardly on the minority: for, take this matter of the
bridge, no man is obliged to work on it if he doesn&rsquo;t agree
to its building.&nbsp; At least, I suppose not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled, and said: &ldquo;Shrewdly put; and yet from the
point of view of the native of another planet.&nbsp; If the man
of the minority does find his feelings hurt, doubtless he may
relieve them by refusing to help in building the bridge.&nbsp;
But, dear neighbour, that is not a very effective salve for the
wound caused by the &lsquo;tyranny of a majority&rsquo; in our
society; because all work that is done is either beneficial or
hurtful to every member of society.&nbsp; The man is benefited by
the bridge-building if it turns out a good thing, and hurt by it
if it turns out a bad one, whether he puts a hand to it or not;
and meanwhile he is benefiting the bridge-builders by his work,
whatever that may be.&nbsp; In fact, I see no help for him except
the pleasure of saying &lsquo;I told you so&rsquo; if the
bridge-building turns out to be a mistake and hurts him; if it
benefits him he must suffer in silence.&nbsp; A terrible tyranny
our Communism, is it not?&nbsp; Folk used often to be warned
against this very unhappiness in times past, when for every
well-fed, contented person you saw a thousand miserable
starvelings.&nbsp; Whereas for us, we grow fat and well-liking on
the tyranny; a tyranny, to say the truth, not to be made visible
by any microscope I know.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my friend;
we are not going to seek for troubles by calling our peace and
plenty and happiness by ill names whose very meaning we have
forgotten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat musing for a little, and then started and said:
&ldquo;Are there any more questions, dear guest?&nbsp; The
morning is waning fast amidst my garrulity?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV: ON THE LACK OF INCENTIVE TO LABOUR IN A COMMUNIST
SOCIETY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was expecting Dick
and Clara to make their appearance any moment: but is there time
to ask just one or two questions before they come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it, dear neighbour&mdash;try it,&rdquo; said old
Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the more you ask me the better I am
pleased; and at any rate if they do come and find me in the
middle of an answer, they must sit quiet and pretend to listen
till I come to an end.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t hurt them; they will
find it quite amusing enough to sit side by side, conscious of
their proximity to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled, as I was bound to, and said: &ldquo;Good; I will go
on talking without noticing them when they come in.&nbsp; Now,
this is what I want to ask you about&mdash;to wit, how you get
people to work when there is no reward of labour, and especially
how you get them to work strenuously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No reward of labour?&rdquo; said Hammond,
gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;The reward of labour is <i>life</i>.&nbsp;
Is that not enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no reward for especially good work,&rdquo; quoth
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of reward,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;the
reward of creation.&nbsp; The wages which God gets, as people
might have said time agone.&nbsp; If you are going to ask to be
paid for the pleasure of creation, which is what excellence in
work means, the next thing we shall hear of will be a bill sent
in for the begetting of children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the man of the
nineteenth century would say there is a natural desire towards
the procreation of children, and a natural desire not to
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I know the ancient
platitude,&mdash;wholly untrue; indeed, to us quite
meaningless.&nbsp; Fourier, whom all men laughed at, understood
the matter better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it meaningless to you?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Because it implies that all work is suffering,
and we are so far from thinking that, that, as you may have
noticed, whereas we are not short of wealth, there is a kind of
fear growing up amongst us that we shall one day be short of
work.&nbsp; It is a pleasure which we are afraid of losing, not a
pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have noticed that, and I
was going to ask you about that also.&nbsp; But in the meantime,
what do you positively mean to assert about the pleasurableness
of work amongst you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, that <i>all</i> work is now pleasurable; either
because of the hope of gain in honour and wealth with which the
work is done, which causes pleasurable excitement, even when the
actual work is not pleasant; or else because it has grown into a
pleasurable <i>habit</i>, as in the case with what you may call
mechanical work; and lastly (and most of our work is of this
kind) because there is conscious sensuous pleasure in the work
itself; it is done, that is, by artists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you now tell me
how you have come to this happy condition?&nbsp; For, to speak
plainly, this change from the conditions of the older world seems
to me far greater and more important than all the other changes
you have told me about as to crime, politics, property,
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right there,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Indeed, you may say rather that it is this change which
makes all the others possible.&nbsp; What is the object of
Revolution?&nbsp; Surely to make people happy.&nbsp; Revolution
having brought its foredoomed change about, how can you prevent
the counter-revolution from setting in except by making people
happy?&nbsp; What! shall we expect peace and stability from
unhappiness?&nbsp; The gathering of grapes from thorns and figs
from thistles is a reasonable expectation compared with
that!&nbsp; And happiness without happy daily work is
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most obviously true,&rdquo; said I: for I thought the
old boy was preaching a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;But answer my
question, as to how you gained this happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Briefly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by the absence of
artificial coercion, and the freedom for every man to do what he
can do best, joined to the knowledge of what productions of
labour we really wanted.&nbsp; I must admit that this knowledge
we reached slowly and painfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;give me more detail;
explain more fully.&nbsp; For this subject interests me
intensely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but in order to do
so I must weary you by talking a little about the past.&nbsp;
Contrast is necessary for this explanation.&nbsp; Do you
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>Said he, settling himself in his chair again for a long talk:
&ldquo;It is clear from all that we hear and read, that in the
last age of civilisation men had got into a vicious circle in the
matter of production of wares.&nbsp; They had reached a wonderful
facility of production, and in order to make the most of that
facility they had gradually created (or allowed to grow, rather)
a most elaborate system of buying and selling, which has been
called the World-Market; and that World-Market, once set a-going,
forced them to go on making more and more of these wares, whether
they needed them or not.&nbsp; So that while (of course) they
could not free themselves from the toil of making real
necessaries, they created in a never-ending series sham or
artificial necessaries, which became, under the iron rule of the
aforesaid World-Market, of equal importance to them with the real
necessaries which supported life.&nbsp; By all this they burdened
themselves with a prodigious mass of work merely for the sake of
keeping their wretched system going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and then?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, since they had forced themselves to stagger
along under this horrible burden of unnecessary production, it
became impossible for them to look upon labour and its results
from any other point of view than one&mdash;to wit, the ceaseless
endeavour to expend the least possible amount of labour on any
article made, and yet at the same time to make as many articles
as possible.&nbsp; To this &lsquo;cheapening of
production&rsquo;, as it was called, everything was sacrificed:
the happiness of the workman at his work, nay, his most
elementary comfort and bare health, his food, his clothes, his
dwelling, his leisure, his amusement, his education&mdash;his
life, in short&mdash;did not weigh a grain of sand in the balance
against this dire necessity of &lsquo;cheap production&rsquo; of
things, a great part of which were not worth producing at
all.&nbsp; Nay, we are told, and we must believe it, so
overwhelming is the evidence, though many of our people scarcely
<i>can</i> believe it, that even rich and powerful men, the
masters of the poor devils aforesaid, submitted to live amidst
sights and sounds and smells which it is in the very nature of
man to abhor and flee from, in order that their riches might
bolster up this supreme folly.&nbsp; The whole community, in
fact, was cast into the jaws of this ravening monster, &lsquo;the
cheap production&rsquo; forced upon it by the
World-Market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what
happened?&nbsp; Did not their cleverness and facility in
production master this chaos of misery at last?&nbsp;
Couldn&rsquo;t they catch up with the World-Market, and then set
to work to devise means for relieving themselves from this
fearful task of extra labour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did they even try to?&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not sure.&nbsp; You know that
according to the old saw the beetle gets used to living in dung;
and these people, whether they found the dung sweet or not,
certainly lived in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His estimate of the life of the nineteenth century made me
catch my breath a little; and I said feebly, &ldquo;But the
labour-saving machines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heyday!&rdquo; quoth he.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that
you are saying? the labour-saving machines?&nbsp; Yes, they were
made to &lsquo;save labour&rsquo; (or, to speak more plainly, the
lives of men) on one piece of work in order that it might be
expended&mdash;I will say wasted&mdash;on another, probably
useless, piece of work.&nbsp; Friend, all their devices for
cheapening labour simply resulted in increasing the burden of
labour.&nbsp; The appetite of the World-Market grew with what it
fed on: the countries within the ring of
&lsquo;civilisation&rsquo; (that is, organised misery) were
glutted with the abortions of the market, and force and fraud
were used unsparingly to &lsquo;open up&rsquo; countries
<i>outside</i> that pale.&nbsp; This process of &lsquo;opening
up&rsquo; is a strange one to those who have read the professions
of the men of that period and do not understand their practice;
and perhaps shows us at its worst the great vice of the
nineteenth century, the use of hypocrisy and cant to evade the
responsibility of vicarious ferocity.&nbsp; When the civilised
World-Market coveted a country not yet in its clutches, some
transparent pretext was found&mdash;the suppression of a slavery
different from and not so cruel as that of commerce; the pushing
of a religion no longer believed in by its promoters; the
&lsquo;rescue&rsquo; of some desperado or homicidal madman whose
misdeeds had got him into trouble amongst the natives of the
&lsquo;barbarous&rsquo; country&mdash;any stick, in short, which
would beat the dog at all.&nbsp; Then some bold, unprincipled,
ignorant adventurer was found (no difficult task in the days of
competition), and he was bribed to &lsquo;create a market&rsquo;
by breaking up whatever traditional society there might be in the
doomed country, and by destroying whatever leisure or pleasure he
found there.&nbsp; He forced wares on the natives which they did
not want, and took their natural products in
&lsquo;exchange,&rsquo; as this form of robbery was called, and
thereby he &lsquo;created new wants,&rsquo; to supply which (that
is, to be allowed to live by their new masters) the hapless,
helpless people had to sell themselves into the slavery of
hopeless toil so that they might have something wherewith to
purchase the nullities of &lsquo;civilisation.&rsquo;&nbsp;

"Ah," said the old man, pointing to the Museum, "I have read books and
papers in there, telling strange stories indeed of the dealings of
civilisation (or organised misery) with 'non-civilisation'; from the time
when the British
Government deliberately sent blankets infected with small-pox as
choice gifts to inconvenient tribes of Red-skins, to the time
when Africa was infested by a man named Stanley,
who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but as you know, time
presses; and I want to keep our question on the straightest line
possible; and I want at once to ask this about these wares made
for the World-Market&mdash;how about their quality; these people
who were so clever about making goods, I suppose they made them
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quality!&rdquo; said the old man crustily, for he was
rather peevish at being cut short in his story; &ldquo;how could
they possibly attend to such trifles as the quality of the wares
they sold?&nbsp; The best of them were of a lowish average, the
worst were transparent make-shifts for the things asked for,
which nobody would have put up with if they could have got
anything else.&nbsp; It was a current jest of the time that the
wares were made to sell and not to use; a jest which you, as
coming from another planet, may understand, but which our folk
could not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;What! did they make nothing well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there was one class of
goods which they did make thoroughly well, and that was the class
of machines which were used for making things.&nbsp; These were
usually quite perfect pieces of workmanship, admirably adapted to
the end in view.&nbsp; So that it may be fairly said that the
great achievement of the nineteenth century was the making of
machines which were wonders of invention, skill, and patience,
and which were used for the production of measureless quantities
of worthless make-shifts.&nbsp; In truth, the owners of the
machines did not consider anything which they made as wares, but
simply as means for the enrichment of themselves.&nbsp; Of course
the only admitted test of utility in wares was the finding of
buyers for them&mdash;wise men or fools, as it might
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And people put up with this?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a time,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then the overturn,&rdquo; said the old man,
smiling, &ldquo;and the nineteenth century saw itself as a man
who has lost his clothes whilst bathing, and has to walk naked
through the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very bitter about that unlucky nineteenth
century,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since I know so much
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent a little, and then said: &ldquo;There are
traditions&mdash;nay, real histories&mdash;in our family about
it: my grandfather was one of its victims.&nbsp; If you know
something about it, you will understand what he suffered when I
tell you that he was in those days a genuine artist, a man of
genius, and a revolutionist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I do understand,&rdquo; said I: &ldquo;but now,
as it seems, you have reversed all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty much so,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;The wares
which we make are made because they are needed: men make for
their neighbours&rsquo; use as if they were making for
themselves, not for a vague market of which they know nothing,
and over which they have no control: as there is no buying and
selling, it would be mere insanity to make goods on the chance of
their being wanted; for there is no longer anyone who can be
compelled to buy them.&nbsp; So that whatever is made is good,
and thoroughly fit for its purpose.&nbsp; Nothing can be made
except for genuine use; therefore no inferior goods are
made.&nbsp; Moreover, as aforesaid, we have now found out what we
want, so we make no more than we want; and as we are not driven
to make a vast quantity of useless things we have time and
resources enough to consider our pleasure in making them.&nbsp;
All work which would be irksome to do by hand is done by
immensely improved machinery; and in all work which it is a
pleasure to do by hand machinery is done without.&nbsp; There is
no difficulty in finding work which suits the special turn of
mind of everybody; so that no man is sacrificed to the wants of
another.&nbsp; From time to time, when we have found out that
some piece of work was too disagreeable or troublesome, we have
given it up and done altogether without the thing produced by
it.&nbsp; Now, surely you can see that under these circumstances
all the work that we do is an exercise of the mind and body more
or less pleasant to be done: so that instead of avoiding work
everybody seeks it: and, since people have got defter in doing
the work generation after generation, it has become so easy to
do, that it seems as if there were less done, though probably
more is produced.&nbsp; I suppose this explains that fear, which
I hinted at just now, of a possible scarcity in work, which
perhaps you have already noticed, and which is a feeling on the
increase, and has been for a score of years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that there is
any fear of a work-famine amongst you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I will tell
why; it is each man&rsquo;s business to make his own work
pleasanter and pleasanter, which of course tends towards raising
the standard of excellence, as no man enjoys turning out work
which is not a credit to him, and also to greater deliberation in
turning it out; and there is such a vast number of things which
can be treated as works of art, that this alone gives employment
to a host of deft people.&nbsp; Again, if art be inexhaustible,
so is science also; and though it is no longer the only innocent
occupation which is thought worth an intelligent man spending his
time upon, as it once was, yet there are, and I suppose will be,
many people who are excited by its conquest of difficulties, and
care for it more than for anything else.&nbsp; Again, as more and
more of pleasure is imported into work, I think we shall take up
kinds of work which produce desirable wares, but which we gave up
because we could not carry them on pleasantly.&nbsp; Moreover, I
think that it is only in parts of Europe which are more advanced
than the rest of the world that you will hear this talk of the
fear of a work-famine.&nbsp; Those lands which were once the
colonies of Great Britain, for instance, and especially
America&mdash;that part of it, above all, which was once the
United states&mdash;are now and will be for a long while a great
resource to us.&nbsp; For these lands, and, I say, especially the
northern parts of America, suffered so terribly from the full
force of the last days of civilisation, and became such horrible
places to live in, that they are now very backward in all that
makes life pleasant.&nbsp; Indeed, one may say that for nearly a
hundred years the people of the northern parts of America have
been engaged in gradually making a dwelling-place out of a
stinking dust-heap; and there is still a great deal to do,
especially as the country is so big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am exceedingly glad to
think that you have such a prospect of happiness before
you.&nbsp; But I should like to ask a few more questions, and
then I have done for to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI: DINNER IN THE HALL OF THE BLOOMSBURY MARKET</h2>
<p>As I spoke, I heard footsteps near the door; the latch
yielded, and in came our two lovers, looking so handsome that one
had no feeling of shame in looking on at their little-concealed
love-making; for indeed it seemed as if all the world must be in
love with them.&nbsp; As for old Hammond, he looked on them like
an artist who has just painted a picture nearly as well as he
thought he could when he began it, and was perfectly happy.&nbsp;
He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, sit down, young folk, and don&rsquo;t make a
noise.&nbsp; Our guest here has still some questions to ask
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should suppose so,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;you
have only been three hours and a half together; and it
isn&rsquo;t to be hoped that the history of two centuries could
be told in three hours and a half: let alone that, for all I
know, you may have been wandering into the realms of geography
and craftsmanship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to noise, my dear kinsman,&rdquo; said Clara,
&ldquo;you will very soon be disturbed by the noise of the
dinner-bell, which I should think will be very pleasant music to
our guest, who breakfasted early, it seems, and probably had a
tiring day yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;Well, since you have spoken the word, I begin
to feel that it is so; but I have been feeding myself with wonder
this long time past: really, it&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; quoth
I, as I saw her smile, O so prettily!&nbsp; But just then from
some tower high up in the air came the sound of silvery chimes
playing a sweet clear tune, that sounded to my unaccustomed ears
like the song of the first blackbird in the spring, and called a
rush of memories to my mind, some of bad times, some of good, but
all sweetened now into mere pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more questions now before dinner,&rdquo; said Clara;
and she took my hand as an affectionate child would, and led me
out of the room and down stairs into the forecourt of the Museum,
leaving the two Hammonds to follow as they pleased.</p>
<p>We went into the market-place which I had been in before, a
thinnish stream of elegantly <a name="citation1"></a><a
href="#footnote1" class="citation">[1]</a> dressed people going
in along with us.&nbsp; We turned into the cloister and came to a
richly moulded and carved doorway, where a very pretty
dark-haired young girl gave us each a beautiful bunch of summer
flowers, and we entered a hall much bigger than that of the
Hammersmith Guest House, more elaborate in its architecture and
perhaps more beautiful.&nbsp; I found it difficult to keep my
eyes off the wall-pictures (for I thought it bad manners to stare
at Clara all the time, though she was quite worth it).&nbsp; I
saw at a glance that their subjects were taken from queer
old-world myths and imaginations which in yesterday&rsquo;s world
only about half a dozen people in the country knew anything
about; and when the two Hammonds sat down opposite to us, I said
to the old man, pointing to the frieze:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange to see such subjects here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why
you should be surprised; everybody knows the tales; and they are
graceful and pleasant subjects, not too tragic for a place where
people mostly eat and drink and amuse themselves, and yet full of
incident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled, and said: &ldquo;Well, I scarcely expected to find
record of the Seven Swans and the King of the Golden Mountain and
Faithful Henry, and such curious pleasant imaginations as Jacob
Grimm got together from the childhood of the world, barely
lingering even in his time: I should have thought you would have
forgotten such childishness by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled, and said nothing; but Dick turned rather
red, and broke out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>do</i> you mean, guest?&nbsp; I think them very
beautiful, I mean not only the pictures, but the stories; and
when we were children we used to imagine them going on in every
wood-end, by the bight of every stream: every house in the fields
was the Fairyland King&rsquo;s House to us.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
remember, Clara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; and it seemed to me as if a
slight cloud came over her fair face.&nbsp; I was going to speak
to her on the subject, when the pretty waitresses came to us
smiling, and chattering sweetly like reed warblers by the river
side, and fell to giving us our dinner.&nbsp; As to this, as at
our breakfast, everything was cooked and served with a daintiness
which showed that those who had prepared it were interested in
it; but there was no excess either of quantity or of gourmandise;
everything was simple, though so excellent of its kind; and it
was made clear to us that this was no feast, only an ordinary
meal.&nbsp; The glass, crockery, and plate were very beautiful to
my eyes, used to the study of medi&aelig;val art; but a
nineteenth-century club-haunter would, I daresay, have found them
rough and lacking in finish; the crockery being lead-glazed
pot-ware, though beautifully ornamented; the only porcelain being
here and there a piece of old oriental ware.&nbsp; The glass,
again, though elegant and quaint, and very varied in form, was
somewhat bubbled and hornier in texture than the commercial
articles of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; The furniture and
general fittings of the hall were much of a piece with the
table-gear, beautiful in form and highly ornamented, but without
the commercial &ldquo;finish&rdquo; of the joiners and
cabinet-makers of our time.&nbsp; Withal, there was a total
absence of what the nineteenth century calls
&ldquo;comfort&rdquo;&mdash;that is, stuffy inconvenience; so
that, even apart from the delightful excitement of the day, I had
never eaten my dinner so pleasantly before.</p>
<p>When we had done eating, and were sitting a little while, with
a bottle of very good Bordeaux wine before us, Clara came back to
the question of the subject-matter of the pictures, as though it
had troubled her.</p>
<p>She looked up at them, and said: &ldquo;How is it that though
we are so interested with our life for the most part, yet when
people take to writing poems or painting pictures they seldom
deal with our modern life, or if they do, take good care to make
their poems or pictures unlike that life?&nbsp; Are we not good
enough to paint ourselves?&nbsp; How is it that we find the
dreadful times of the past so interesting to us&mdash;in pictures
and poetry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Hammond smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;It always was so, and I
suppose always will be,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;however it may be
explained.&nbsp; It is true that in the nineteenth century, when
there was so little art and so much talk about it, there was a
theory that art and imaginative literature ought to deal with
contemporary life; but they never did so; for, if there was any
pretence of it, the author always took care (as Clara hinted just
now) to disguise, or exaggerate, or idealise, and in some way or
another make it strange; so that, for all the verisimilitude
there was, he might just as well have dealt with the times of the
Pharaohs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;surely it is but natural
to like these things strange; just as when we were children, as I
said just now, we used to pretend to be so-and-so in
such-and-such a place.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what these pictures and
poems do; and why shouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast hit it, Dick,&rdquo; quoth old Hammond;
&ldquo;it is the child-like part of us that produces works of
imagination.&nbsp; When we are children time passes so slow with
us that we seem to have time for everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed, and then smiled and said: &ldquo;At least let us
rejoice that we have got back our childhood again.&nbsp; I drink
to the days that are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second childhood,&rdquo; said I in a low voice, and
then blushed at my double rudeness, and hoped that he
hadn&rsquo;t heard.&nbsp; But he had, and turned to me smiling,
and said: &ldquo;Yes, why not?&nbsp; And for my part, I hope it
may last long; and that the world&rsquo;s next period of wise and
unhappy manhood, if that should happen, will speedily lead us to
a third childhood: if indeed this age be not our third.&nbsp;
Meantime, my friend, you must know that we are too happy, both
individually and collectively, to trouble ourselves about what is
to come hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; said Clara, &ldquo;I wish we
were interesting enough to be written or painted
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick answered her with some lover&rsquo;s speech, impossible
to be written down, and then we sat quiet a little.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII: HOW THE CHANGE CAME</h2>
<p>Dick broke the silence at last, saying: &ldquo;Guest, forgive
us for a little after-dinner dulness.&nbsp; What would you like
to do?&nbsp; Shall we have out Greylocks and trot back to
Hammersmith? or will you come with us and hear some Welsh folk
sing in a hall close by here? or would you like presently to come
with me into the City and see some really fine building?
or&mdash;what shall it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as I am a stranger, I must
let you choose for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In point of fact, I did not by any means want to be
&lsquo;amused&rsquo; just then; and also I rather felt as if the
old man, with his knowledge of past times, and even a kind of
inverted sympathy for them caused by his active hatred of them,
was as it were a blanket for me against the cold of this very new
world, where I was, so to say, stripped bare of every habitual
thought and way of acting; and I did not want to leave him too
soon.&nbsp; He came to my rescue at once, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, Dick; there is someone else to be consulted
besides you and the guest here, and that is I.&nbsp; I am not
going to lose the pleasure of his company just now, especially as
I know he has something else to ask me.&nbsp; So go to your
Welshmen, by all means; but first of all bring us another bottle
of wine to this nook, and then be off as soon as you like; and
come again and fetch our friend to go westward, but not too
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick nodded smilingly, and the old man and I were soon alone
in the great hall, the afternoon sun gleaming on the red wine in
our tall quaint-shaped glasses.&nbsp; Then said Hammond:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does anything especially puzzle you about our way of
living, now you have heard a good deal and seen a little of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;I think what puzzles me most is how it all came
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It well may,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so great as the
change is.&nbsp; It would be difficult indeed to tell you the
whole story, perhaps impossible: knowledge, discontent,
treachery, disappointment, ruin, misery, despair&mdash;those who
worked for the change because they could see further than other
people went through all these phases of suffering; and doubtless
all the time the most of men looked on, not knowing what was
doing, thinking it all a matter of course, like the rising and
setting of the sun&mdash;and indeed it was so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me one thing, if you can,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did the change, the &lsquo;revolution&rsquo; it used to be
called, come peacefully?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peacefully?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what peace was there
amongst those poor confused wretches of the nineteenth
century?&nbsp; It was war from beginning to end: bitter war, till
hope and pleasure put an end to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean actual fighting with weapons?&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;or the strikes and lock-outs and starvation of which we
have heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both, both,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;As a matter of
fact, the history of the terrible period of transition from
commercial slavery to freedom may thus be summarised.&nbsp; When
the hope of realising a communal condition of life for all men
arose, quite late in the nineteenth century, the power of the
middle classes, the then tyrants of society, was so enormous and
crushing, that to almost all men, even those who had, you may say
despite themselves, despite their reason and judgment, conceived
such hopes, it seemed a dream.&nbsp; So much was this the case
that some of those more enlightened men who were then called
Socialists, although they well knew, and even stated in public,
that the only reasonable condition of Society was that of pure
Communism (such as you now see around you), yet shrunk from what
seemed to them the barren task of preaching the realisation of a
happy dream.&nbsp; Looking back now, we can see that the great
motive-power of the change was a longing for freedom and
equality, akin if you please to the unreasonable passion of the
lover; a sickness of heart that rejected with loathing the
aimless solitary life of the well-to-do educated man of that
time: phrases, my dear friend, which have lost their meaning to
us of the present day; so far removed we are from the dreadful
facts which they represent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, these men, though conscious of this feeling, had
no faith in it, as a means of bringing about the change.&nbsp;
Nor was that wonderful: for looking around them they saw the huge
mass of the oppressed classes too much burdened with the misery
of their lives, and too much overwhelmed by the selfishness of
misery, to be able to form a conception of any escape from it
except by the ordinary way prescribed by the system of slavery
under which they lived; which was nothing more than a remote
chance of climbing out of the oppressed into the oppressing
class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, though they knew that the only reasonable
aim for those who would better the world was a condition of
equality; in their impatience and despair they managed to
convince themselves that if they could by hook or by crook get
the machinery of production and the management of property so
altered that the &lsquo;lower classes&rsquo; (so the horrible
word ran) might have their slavery somewhat ameliorated, they
would be ready to fit into this machinery, and would use it for
bettering their condition still more and still more, until at
last the result would be a practical equality (they were very
fond of using the word &lsquo;practical&rsquo;), because
&lsquo;the rich&rsquo; would be forced to pay so much for keeping
&lsquo;the poor&rsquo; in a tolerable condition that the
condition of riches would become no longer valuable and would
gradually die out.&nbsp; Do you follow me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said old Hammond: &ldquo;Well, since you follow me, you will
see that as a theory this was not altogether unreasonable; but
&lsquo;practically,&rsquo; it turned out a failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;because it involved the making of a machinery by those who
didn&rsquo;t know what they wanted the machines to do.&nbsp; So
far as the masses of the oppressed class furthered this scheme of
improvement, they did it to get themselves improved
slave-rations&mdash;as many of them as could.&nbsp; And if those
classes had really been incapable of being touched by that
instinct which produced the passion for freedom and equality
aforesaid, what would have happened, I think, would have been
this: that a certain part of the working classes would have been
so far improved in condition that they would have approached the
condition of the middling rich men; but below them would have
been a great class of most miserable slaves, whose slavery would
have been far more hopeless than the older class-slavery had
been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What stood in the way of this?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;just that
instinct for freedom aforesaid.&nbsp; It is true that the
slave-class could not conceive the happiness of a free
life.&nbsp; Yet they grew to understand (and very speedily too)
that they were oppressed by their masters, and they assumed, you
see how justly, that they could do without them, though perhaps
they scarce knew how; so that it came to this, that though they
could not look forward to the happiness or peace of the freeman,
they did at least look forward to the war which a vague hope told
them would bring that peace about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you tell me rather more closely what actually
took place?&rdquo; said I; for I thought <i>him</i> rather vague
here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can.&nbsp; That machinery
of life for the use of people who didn&rsquo;t know what they
wanted of it, and which was known at the time as State Socialism,
was partly put in motion, though in a very piecemeal way.&nbsp;
But it did not work smoothly; it was, of course, resisted at
every turn by the capitalists; and no wonder, for it tended more
and more to upset the commercial system I have told you of;
without providing anything really effective in its place.&nbsp;
The result was growing confusion, great suffering amongst the
working classes, and, as a consequence, great discontent.&nbsp;
For a long time matters went on like this.&nbsp; The power of the
upper classes had lessened, as their command over wealth
lessened, and they could not carry things wholly by the high hand
as they had been used to in earlier days.&nbsp; So far the State
Socialists were justified by the result.&nbsp; On the other hand,
the working classes were ill-organised, and growing poorer in
reality, in spite of the gains (also real in the long run) which
they had forced from the masters.&nbsp; Thus matters hung in the
balance; the masters could not reduce their slaves to complete
subjection, though they put down some feeble and partial riots
easily enough.&nbsp; The workers forced their masters to grant
them ameliorations, real or imaginary, of their condition, but
could not force freedom from them.&nbsp; At last came a great
crash.&nbsp; To explain this you must understand that very great
progress had been made amongst the workers, though as before said
but little in the direction of improved livelihood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I played the innocent and said: &ldquo;In what direction could
they improve, if not in livelihood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;In the power to bring about a state of things
in which livelihood would be full, and easy to gain.&nbsp; They
had at last learned how to combine after a long period of
mistakes and disasters.&nbsp; The workmen had now a regular
organization in the struggle against their masters, a struggle
which for more than half a century had been accepted as an
inevitable part of the conditions of the modern system of labour
and production.&nbsp; This combination had now taken the form of
a federation of all or almost all the recognised wage-paid
employments, and it was by its means that those betterments of
the conditions of the workmen had been forced from the masters:
and though they were not seldom mixed up with the rioting that
happened, especially in the earlier days of their organization,
it by no means formed an essential part of their tactics; indeed
at the time I am now speaking of they had got to be so strong
that most commonly the mere threat of a &lsquo;strike&rsquo; was
enough to gain any minor point: because they had given up the
foolish tactics of the ancient trades unions of calling out of
work a part only of the workers of such and such an industry, and
supporting them while out of work on the labour of those that
remained in.&nbsp; By this time they had a biggish fund of money
for the support of strikes, and could stop a certain industry
altogether for a time if they so determined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;Was there not a serious danger of such moneys
being misused&mdash;of jobbery, in fact?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Hammond wriggled uneasily on his seat, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though all this happened so long ago, I still feel the
pain of mere shame when I have to tell you that it was more than
a danger: that such rascality often happened; indeed more than
once the whole combination seemed dropping to pieces because of
it: but at the time of which I am telling, things looked so
threatening, and to the workmen at least the necessity of their
dealing with the fast-gathering trouble which the labour-struggle
had brought about, was so clear, that the conditions of the times
had begot a deep seriousness amongst all reasonable people; a
determination which put aside all non-essentials, and which to
thinking men was ominous of the swiftly-approaching change: such
an element was too dangerous for mere traitors and self-seekers,
and one by one they were thrust out and mostly joined the
declared reactionaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about those ameliorations,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;what were they? or rather of what nature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;Some of them, and these of the most practical
importance to the mens&rsquo; livelihood, were yielded by the
masters by direct compulsion on the part of the men; the new
conditions of labour so gained were indeed only customary,
enforced by no law: but, once established, the masters durst not
attempt to withdraw them in face of the growing power of the
combined workers.&nbsp; Some again were steps on the path of
&lsquo;State Socialism&rsquo;; the most important of which can be
speedily summed up.&nbsp; At the end of the nineteenth century
the cry arose for compelling the masters to employ their men a
less number of hours in the day: this cry gathered volume
quickly, and the masters had to yield to it.&nbsp; But it was, of
course, clear that unless this meant a higher price for work per
hour, it would be a mere nullity, and that the masters, unless
forced, would reduce it to that.&nbsp; Therefore after a long
struggle another law was passed fixing a minimum price for labour
in the most important industries; which again had to be
supplemented by a law fixing the maximum price on the chief wares
then considered necessary for a workman&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were getting perilously near to the late Roman
poor-rates,&rdquo; said I, smiling, &ldquo;and the doling out of
bread to the proletariat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So many said at the time,&rdquo; said the old man
drily; &ldquo;and it has long been a commonplace that that slough
awaits State Socialism in the end, if it gets to the end, which
as you know it did not with us.&nbsp; However it went further
than this minimum and maximum business, which by the by we can
now see was necessary.&nbsp; The government now found it
imperative on them to meet the outcry of the master class at the
approaching destruction of Commerce (as desirable, had they known
it, as the extinction of the cholera, which has since happily
taken place).&nbsp; And they were forced to meet it by a measure
hostile to the masters, the establishment of government factories
for the production of necessary wares, and markets for their
sale.&nbsp; These measures taken altogether did do something:
they were in fact of the nature of regulations made by the
commander of a beleaguered city.&nbsp; But of course to the
privileged classes it seemed as if the end of the world were come
when such laws were enacted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor was that altogether without a warrant: the spread
of communistic theories, and the partial practice of State
Socialism had at first disturbed, and at last almost paralysed
the marvellous system of commerce under which the old world had
lived so feverishly, and had produced for some few a life of
gambler&rsquo;s pleasure, and for many, or most, a life of mere
misery: over and over again came &lsquo;bad times&rsquo; as they
were called, and indeed they were bad enough for the
wage-slaves.&nbsp; The year 1952 was one of the worst of these
times; the workmen suffered dreadfully: the partial, inefficient
government factories, which were terribly jobbed, all but broke
down, and a vast part of the population had for the time being to
be fed on undisguised &ldquo;charity&rdquo; as it was called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Combined Workers watched the situation with mingled
hope and anxiety.&nbsp; They had already formulated their general
demands; but now by a solemn and universal vote of the whole of
their federated societies, they insisted on the first step being
taken toward carrying out their demands: this step would have led
directly to handing over the management of the whole natural
resources of the country, together with the machinery for using
them into the power of the Combined Workers, and the reduction of
the privileged classes into the position of pensioners obviously
dependent on the pleasure of the workers.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Resolution,&rsquo; as it was called, which was widely
published in the newspapers of the day, was in fact a declaration
of war, and was so accepted by the master class.&nbsp; They began
henceforward to prepare for a firm stand against the
&lsquo;brutal and ferocious communism of the day,&rsquo; as they
phrased it.&nbsp; And as they were in many ways still very
powerful, or seemed so to be; they still hoped by means of brute
force to regain some of what they had lost, and perhaps in the
end the whole of it.&nbsp; It was said amongst them on all hands
that it had been a great mistake of the various governments not
to have resisted sooner; and the liberals and radicals (the name
as perhaps you may know of the more democratically inclined part
of the ruling classes) were much blamed for having led the world
to this pass by their mis-timed pedantry and foolish
sentimentality: and one Gladstone, or Gledstein (probably,
judging by this name, of Scandinavian descent), a notable
politician of the nineteenth century, was especially singled out
for reprobation in this respect.&nbsp; I need scarcely point out
to you the absurdity of all this.&nbsp; But terrible tragedy lay
hidden behind this grinning through a horse-collar of the
reactionary party.&nbsp; &lsquo;The insatiable greed of the lower
classes must be repressed&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;The people must be
taught a lesson&rsquo;&mdash;these were the sacramental phrases
current amongst the reactionists, and ominous enough they
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man stopped to look keenly at my attentive and
wondering face; and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, dear guest, that I have been using words and
phrases which few people amongst us could understand without long
and laborious explanation; and not even then perhaps.&nbsp; But
since you have not yet gone to sleep, and since I am speaking to
you as to a being from another planet, I may venture to ask you
if you have followed me thus far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I quite understand: pray
go on; a great deal of what you have been saying was common place
with us&mdash;when&mdash;when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he gravely, &ldquo;when you were
dwelling in the other planet.&nbsp; Well, now for the crash
aforesaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On some comparatively trifling occasion a great meeting
was summoned by the workmen leaders to meet in Trafalgar Square
(about the right to meet in which place there had for years and
years been bickering).&nbsp; The civic bourgeois guard (called
the police) attacked the said meeting with bludgeons, according
to their custom; many people were hurt in the
<i>m&eacute;l&eacute;e</i>, of whom five in all died, either
trampled to death on the spot, or from the effects of their
cudgelling; the meeting was scattered, and some hundred of
prisoners cast into gaol.&nbsp; A similar meeting had been
treated in the same way a few days before at a place called
Manchester, which has now disappeared.&nbsp; Thus the
&lsquo;lesson&rsquo; began.&nbsp; The whole country was thrown
into a ferment by this; meetings were held which attempted some
rough organisation for the holding of another meeting to retort
on the authorities.&nbsp; A huge crowd assembled in Trafalgar
Square and the neighbourhood (then a place of crowded streets),
and was too big for the bludgeon-armed police to cope with; there
was a good deal of dry-blow fighting; three or four of the people
were killed, and half a score of policemen were crushed to death
in the throng, and the rest got away as they could.&nbsp; This
was a victory for the people as far as it went.&nbsp; The next
day all London (remember what it was in those days) was in a
state of turmoil.&nbsp; Many of the rich fled into the country;
the executive got together soldiery, but did not dare to use
them; and the police could not be massed in any one place,
because riots or threats of riots were everywhere.&nbsp; But in
Manchester, where the people were not so courageous or not so
desperate as in London, several of the popular leaders were
arrested.&nbsp; In London a convention of leaders was got
together from the Federation of Combined Workmen, and sat under
the old revolutionary name of the Committee of Public Safety; but
as they had no drilled and armed body of men to direct, they
attempted no aggressive measures, but only placarded the walls
with somewhat vague appeals to the workmen not to allow
themselves to be trampled upon.&nbsp; However, they called a
meeting in Trafalgar Square for the day fortnight of the
last-mentioned skirmish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meantime the town grew no quieter, and business came
pretty much to an end.&nbsp; The newspapers&mdash;then, as always
hitherto, almost entirely in the hands of the
masters&mdash;clamoured to the Government for repressive
measures; the rich citizens were enrolled as an extra body of
police, and armed with bludgeons like them; many of these were
strong, well-fed, full-blooded young men, and had plenty of
stomach for fighting; but the Government did not dare to use
them, and contented itself with getting full powers voted to it
by the Parliament for suppressing any revolt, and bringing up
more and more soldiers to London.&nbsp; Thus passed the week
after the great meeting; almost as large a one was held on the
Sunday, which went off peaceably on the whole, as no opposition
to it was offered, and again the people cried
&lsquo;victory.&rsquo;&nbsp; But on the Monday the people woke up
to find that they were hungry.&nbsp; During the last few days
there had been groups of men parading the streets asking (or, if
you please, demanding) money to buy food; and what for goodwill,
what for fear, the richer people gave them a good deal.&nbsp; The
authorities of the parishes also (I haven&rsquo;t time to explain
that phrase at present) gave willy-nilly what provisions they
could to wandering people; and the Government, by means of its
feeble national workshops, also fed a good number of half-starved
folk.&nbsp; But in addition to this, several bakers&rsquo; shops
and other provision stores had been emptied without a great deal
of disturbance.&nbsp; So far, so good.&nbsp; But on the Monday in
question the Committee of Public Safety, on the one hand afraid
of general unorganised pillage, and on the other emboldened by
the wavering conduct of the authorities, sent a deputation
provided with carts and all necessary gear to clear out two or
three big provision stores in the centre of the town, leaving
papers with the shop managers promising to pay the price of them:
and also in the part of the town where they were strongest they
took possession of several bakers&rsquo; shops and set men at
work in them for the benefit of the people;&mdash;all of which
was done with little or no disturbance, the police assisting in
keeping order at the sack of the stores, as they would have done
at a big fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But at this last stroke the reactionaries were so
alarmed, that they were, determined to force the executive into
action.&nbsp; The newspapers next day all blazed into the fury of
frightened people, and threatened the people, the Government, and
everybody they could think of, unless &lsquo;order were at once
restored.&rsquo;&nbsp; A deputation of leading commercial people
waited on the Government and told them that if they did not at
once arrest the Committee of Public Safety, they themselves would
gather a body of men, arm them, and fall on &lsquo;the
incendiaries,&rsquo; as they called them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They, together with a number of the newspaper editors,
had a long interview with the heads of the Government and two or
three military men, the deftest in their art that the country
could furnish.&nbsp; The deputation came away from that
interview, says a contemporary eye-witness, smiling and
satisfied, and said no more about raising an anti-popular army,
but that afternoon left London with their families for their
country seats or elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next morning the Government proclaimed a state of
siege in London,&mdash;a thing common enough amongst the
absolutist governments on the Continent, but unheard-of in
England in those days.&nbsp; They appointed the youngest and
cleverest of their generals to command the proclaimed district; a
man who had won a certain sort of reputation in the disgraceful
wars in which the country had been long engaged from time to
time.&nbsp; The newspapers were in ecstacies, and all the most
fervent of the reactionaries now came to the front; men who in
ordinary times were forced to keep their opinions to themselves
or their immediate circle, but who began to look forward to
crushing once for all the Socialist, and even democratic
tendencies, which, said they, had been treated with such foolish
indulgence for the last sixty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the clever general took no visible action; and yet
only a few of the minor newspapers abused him; thoughtful men
gathered from this that a plot was hatching.&nbsp; As for the
Committee of Public Safety, whatever they thought of their
position, they had now gone too far to draw back; and many of
them, it seems, thought that the government would not act.&nbsp;
They went on quietly organising their food supply, which was a
miserable driblet when all is said; and also as a retort to the
state of siege, they armed as many men as they could in the
quarter where they were strongest, but did not attempt to drill
or organise them, thinking, perhaps, that they could not at the
best turn them into trained soldiers till they had some breathing
space.&nbsp; The clever general, his soldiers, and the police did
not meddle with all this in the least in the world; and things
were quieter in London that week-end; though there were riots in
many places of the provinces, which were quelled by the
authorities without much trouble.&nbsp; The most serious of these
were at Glasgow and Bristol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the Sunday of the meeting came, and great crowds
came to Trafalgar Square in procession, the greater part of the
Committee amongst them, surrounded by their band of men armed
somehow or other.&nbsp; The streets were quite peaceful and
quiet, though there were many spectators to see the procession
pass.&nbsp; Trafalgar Square had no body of police in it; the
people took quiet possession of it, and the meeting began.&nbsp;
The armed men stood round the principal platform, and there were
a few others armed amidst the general crowd; but by far the
greater part were unarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people thought the meeting would go off peaceably;
but the members of the Committee had heard from various quarters
that something would be attempted against them; but these rumours
were vague, and they had no idea of what threatened.&nbsp; They
soon found out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For before the streets about the Square were filled, a
body of soldiers poured into it from the north-west corner and
took up their places by the houses that stood on the west
side.&nbsp; The people growled at the sight of the red-coats; the
armed men of the Committee stood undecided, not knowing what to
do; and indeed this new influx so jammed the crowd together that,
unorganised as they were, they had little chance of working
through it.&nbsp; They had scarcely grasped the fact of their
enemies being there, when another column of soldiers, pouring out
of the streets which led into the great southern road going down
to the Parliament House (still existing, and called the Dung
Market), and also from the embankment by the side of the Thames,
marched up, pushing the crowd into a denser and denser mass, and
formed along the south side of the Square.&nbsp; Then any of
those who could see what was going on, knew at once that they
were in a trap, and could only wonder what would be done with
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The closely-packed crowd would not or could not budge,
except under the influence of the height of terror, which was
soon to be supplied to them.&nbsp; A few of the armed men
struggled to the front, or climbled up to the base of the
monument which then stood there, that they might face the wall of
hidden fire before them; and to most men (there were many women
amongst them) it seemed as if the end of the world had come, and
to-day seemed strangely different from yesterday.&nbsp; No sooner
were the soldiers drawn up aforesaid than, says an eye-witness,
&lsquo;a glittering officer on horseback came prancing out from
the ranks on the south, and read something from a paper which he
held in his hand; which something, very few heard; but I was told
afterwards that it was an order for us to disperse, and a warning
that he had legal right to fire on the crowd else, and that he
would do so.&nbsp; The crowd took it as a challenge of some sort,
and a hoarse threatening roar went up from them; and after that
there was comparative silence for a little, till the officer had
got back into the ranks.&nbsp; I was near the edge of the crowd,
towards the soldiers,&rsquo; says this eye-witness, &lsquo;and I
saw three little machines being wheeled out in front of the
ranks, which I knew for mechanical guns.&nbsp; I cried out,
&ldquo;Throw yourselves down! they are going to
fire!&rdquo;&nbsp; But no one scarcely could throw himself down,
so tight as the crowd were packed.&nbsp; I heard a sharp order
given, and wondered where I should be the next minute; and
then&mdash;It was as if&mdash;the earth had opened, and hell had
come up bodily amidst us.&nbsp; It is no use trying to describe
the scene that followed.&nbsp; Deep lanes were mowed amidst the
thick crowd; the dead and dying covered the ground, and the
shrieks and wails and cries of horror filled all the air, till it
seemed as if there were nothing else in the world but murder and
death.&nbsp; Those of our armed men who were still unhurt cheered
wildly and opened a scattering fire on the soldiers.&nbsp; One or
two soldiers fell; and I saw the officers going up and down the
ranks urging the men to fire again; but they received the orders
in sullen silence, and let the butts of their guns fall.&nbsp;
Only one sergeant ran to a machine-gun and began to set it going;
but a tall young man, an officer too, ran out of the ranks and
dragged him back by the collar; and the soldiers stood there
motionless while the horror-stricken crowd, nearly wholly unarmed
(for most of the armed men had fallen in that first discharge),
drifted out of the Square.&nbsp; I was told afterwards that the
soldiers on the west side had fired also, and done their part of
the slaughter.&nbsp; How I got out of the Square I scarcely know:
I went, not feeling the ground under me, what with rage and
terror and despair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So says our eye-witness.&nbsp; The number of the slain
on the side of the people in that shooting during a minute was
prodigious; but it was not easy to come at the truth about it; it
was probably between one and two thousand.&nbsp; Of the soldiers,
six were killed outright, and a dozen wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I listened, trembling with excitement.&nbsp; The old
man&rsquo;s eyes glittered and his face flushed as he spoke, and
told the tale of what I had often thought might happen.&nbsp; Yet
I wondered that he should have got so elated about a mere
massacre, and I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fearful!&nbsp; And I suppose that this massacre put
an end to the whole revolution for that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried old Hammond; &ldquo;it began
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He filled his glass and mine, and stood up and cried out,
&ldquo;Drink this glass to the memory of those who died there,
for indeed it would be a long tale to tell how much we owe
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I drank, and he sat down again and went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That massacre of Trafalgar Square began the civil war,
though, like all such events, it gathered head slowly, and people
scarcely knew what a crisis they were acting in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible as the massacre was, and hideous and
overpowering as the first terror had been, when the people had
time to think about it, their feeling was one of anger rather
than fear; although the military organisation of the state of
siege was now carried out without shrinking by the clever young
general.&nbsp; For though the ruling-classes when the news spread
next morning felt one gasp of horror and even dread, yet the
Government and their immediate backers felt that now the wine was
drawn and must be drunk.&nbsp; However, even the most reactionary
of the capitalist papers, with two exceptions, stunned by the
tremendous news, simply gave an account of what had taken place,
without making any comment upon it.&nbsp; The exceptions were
one, a so-called &lsquo;liberal&rsquo; paper (the Government of
the day was of that complexion), which, after a preamble in which
it declared its undeviating sympathy with the cause of labour,
proceeded to point out that in times of revolutionary disturbance
it behoved the Government to be just but firm, and that by far
the most merciful way of dealing with the poor madmen who were
attacking the very foundations of society (which had made them
mad and poor) was to shoot them at once, so as to stop others
from drifting into a position in which they would run a chance of
being shot.&nbsp; In short, it praised the determined action of
the Government as the acme of human wisdom and mercy, and exulted
in the inauguration of an epoch of reasonable democracy free from
the tyrannical fads of Socialism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other exception was a paper thought to be one of
the most violent opponents of democracy, and so it was; but the
editor of it found his manhood, and spoke for himself and not for
his paper.&nbsp; In a few simple, indignant words he asked people
to consider what a society was worth which had to be defended by
the massacre of unarmed citizens, and called on the Government to
withdraw their state of siege and put the general and his
officers who fired on the people on their trial for murder.&nbsp;
He went further, and declared that whatever his opinion might be
as to the doctrines of the Socialists, he for one should throw in
his lot with the people, until the Government atoned for their
atrocity by showing that they were prepared to listen to the
demands of men who knew what they wanted, and whom the
decrepitude of society forced into pushing their demands in some
way or other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, this editor was immediately arrested by the
military power; but his bold words were already in the hands of
the public, and produced a great effect: so great an effect that
the Government, after some vacillation, withdrew the state of
siege; though at the same time it strengthened the military
organisation and made it more stringent.&nbsp; Three of the
Committee of Public Safety had been slain in Trafalgar Square: of
the rest the greater part went back to their old place of
meeting, and there awaited the event calmly.&nbsp; They were
arrested there on the Monday morning, and would have been shot at
once by the general, who was a mere military machine, if the
Government had not shrunk before the responsibility of killing
men without any trial.&nbsp; There was at first a talk of trying
them by a special commission of judges, as it was
called&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, before a set of men bound to find them
guilty, and whose business it was to do so.&nbsp; But with the
Government the cold fit had succeeded to the hot one; and the
prisoners were brought before a jury at the assizes.&nbsp; There
a fresh blow awaited the Government; for in spite of the
judge&rsquo;s charge, which distinctly instructed the jury to
find the prisoners guilty, they were acquitted, and the jury
added to their verdict a presentment, in which they condemned the
action of the soldiery, in the queer phraseology of the day, as
&lsquo;rash, unfortunate, and unnecessary.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
Committee of Public Safety renewed its sittings, and from
thenceforth was a popular rallying-point in opposition to the
Parliament.&nbsp; The Government now gave way on all sides, and
made a show of yielding to the demands of the people, though
there was a widespread plot for effecting a coup
d&rsquo;&eacute;tat set on foot between the leaders of the two
so-called opposing parties in the parliamentary faction
fight.&nbsp; The well-meaning part of the public was overjoyed,
and thought that all danger of a civil war was over.&nbsp; The
victory of the people was celebrated by huge meetings held in the
parks and elsewhere, in memory of the victims of the great
massacre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the measures passed for the relief of the workers,
though to the upper classes they seemed ruinously revolutionary,
were not thorough enough to give the people food and a decent
life, and they had to be supplemented by unwritten enactments
without legality to back them.&nbsp; Although the Government and
Parliament had the law-courts, the army, and
&lsquo;society&rsquo; at their backs, the Committee of Public
Safety began to be a force in the country, and really represented
the producing classes.&nbsp; It began to improve immensely in the
days which followed on the acquittal of its members.&nbsp; Its
old members had little administrative capacity, though with the
exception of a few self-seekers and traitors, they were honest,
courageous men, and many of them were endowed with considerable
talent of other kinds.&nbsp; But now that the times called for
immediate action, came forward the men capable of setting it on
foot; and a new network of workmen&rsquo;s associations grew up
very speedily, whose avowed single object was the tiding over of
the ship of the community into a simple condition of Communism;
and as they practically undertook also the management of the
ordinary labour-war, they soon became the mouthpiece and
intermediary of the whole of the working classes; and the
manufacturing profit-grinders now found themselves powerless
before this combination; unless <i>their</i> committee,
Parliament, plucked up courage to begin the civil war again, and
to shoot right and left, they were bound to yield to the demands
of the men whom they employed, and pay higher and higher wages
for shorter and shorter day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Yet one ally they
had, and that was the rapidly approaching breakdown of the whole
system founded on the World-Market and its supply; which now
became so clear to all people, that the middle classes, shocked
for the moment into condemnation of the Government for the great
massacre, turned round nearly in a mass, and called on the
Government to look to matters, and put an end to the tyranny of
the Socialist leaders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus stimulated, the reactionist plot exploded probably
before it was ripe; but this time the people and their leaders
were forewarned, and, before the reactionaries could get under
way, had taken the steps they thought necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Liberal Government (clearly by collusion) was
beaten by the Conservatives, though the latter were nominally
much in the minority.&nbsp; The popular representatives in the
House understood pretty well what this meant, and after an
attempt to fight the matter out by divisions in the House of
Commons, they made a protest, left the House, and came in a body
to the Committee of Public Safety: and the civil war began again
in good earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet its first act was not one of mere fighting.&nbsp;
The new Tory Government determined to act, yet durst not re-enact
the state of siege, but it sent a body of soldiers and police to
arrest the Committee of Public Safety in the lump.&nbsp; They
made no resistance, though they might have done so, as they had
now a considerable body of men who were quite prepared for
extremities.&nbsp; But they were determined to try first a weapon
which they thought stronger than street fighting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The members of the Committee went off quietly to
prison; but they had left their soul and their organisation
behind them.&nbsp; For they depended not on a carefully arranged
centre with all kinds of checks and counter-checks about it, but
on a huge mass of people in thorough sympathy with the movement,
bound together by a great number of links of small centres with
very simple instructions.&nbsp; These instructions were now
carried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next morning, when the leaders of the reaction were
chuckling at the effect which the report in the newspapers of
their stroke would have upon the public&mdash;no newspapers
appeared; and it was only towards noon that a few straggling
sheets, about the size of the gazettes of the seventeenth
century, worked by policemen, soldiers, managers, and
press-writers, were dribbled through the streets.&nbsp; They were
greedily seized on and read; but by this time the serious part of
their news was stale, and people did not need to be told that the
GENERAL STRIKE had begun.&nbsp; The railways did not run, the
telegraph-wires were unserved; flesh, fish, and green stuff
brought to market was allowed to lie there still packed and
perishing; the thousands of middle-class families, who were
utterly dependant for the next meal on the workers, made frantic
efforts through their more energetic members to cater for the
needs of the day, and amongst those of them who could throw off
the fear of what was to follow, there was, I am told, a certain
enjoyment of this unexpected picnic&mdash;a forecast of the days
to come, in which all labour grew pleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So passed the first day, and towards evening the
Government grew quite distracted.&nbsp; They had but one resource
for putting down any popular movement&mdash;to wit, mere
brute-force; but there was nothing for them against which to use
their army and police: no armed bodies appeared in the streets;
the offices of the Federated Workmen were now, in appearance, at
least, turned into places for the relief of people thrown out of
work, and under the circumstances, they durst not arrest the men
engaged in such business, all the more, as even that night many
quite respectable people applied at these offices for relief, and
swallowed down the charity of the revolutionists along with their
supper.&nbsp; So the Government massed soldiers and police here
and there&mdash;and sat still for that night, fully expecting on
the morrow some manifesto from &lsquo;the rebels,&rsquo; as they
now began to be called, which would give them an opportunity of
acting in some way or another.&nbsp; They were
disappointed.&nbsp; The ordinary newspapers gave up the struggle
that morning, and only one very violent reactionary paper (called
the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>) attempted an appearance, and rated
&lsquo;the rebels&rsquo; in good set terms for their folly and
ingratitude in tearing out the bowels of their &lsquo;common
mother,&rsquo; the English Nation, for the benefit of a few
greedy paid agitators, and the fools whom they were
deluding.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Socialist papers (of which
three only, representing somewhat different schools, were
published in London) came out full to the throat of well-printed
matter.&nbsp; They were greedily bought by the whole public, who,
of course, like the Government, expected a manifesto in
them.&nbsp; But they found no word of reference to the great
subject.&nbsp; It seemed as if their editors had ransacked their
drawers for articles which would have been in place forty years
before, under the technical name of educational articles.&nbsp;
Most of these were admirable and straightforward expositions of
the doctrines and practice of Socialism, free from haste and
spite and hard words, and came upon the public with a kind of
May-day freshness, amidst the worry and terror of the moment; and
though the knowing well understood that the meaning of this move
in the game was mere defiance, and a token of irreconcilable
hostility to the then rulers of society, and though, also, they
were meant for nothing else by &lsquo;the rebels,&rsquo; yet they
really had their effect as &lsquo;educational
articles.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, &lsquo;education&rsquo; of
another kind was acting upon the public with irresistible power,
and probably cleared their heads a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the Government, they were absolutely terrified by
this act of &lsquo;boycotting&rsquo; (the slang word then current
for such acts of abstention).&nbsp; Their counsels became wild
and vacillating to the last degree: one hour they were for giving
way for the present till they could hatch another plot; the next
they all but sent an order for the arrest in the lump of all the
workmen&rsquo;s committees; the next they were on the point of
ordering their brisk young general to take any excuse that
offered for another massacre.&nbsp; But when they called to mind
that the soldiery in that &lsquo;Battle&rsquo; of Trafalgar
Square were so daunted by the slaughter which they had made, that
they could not be got to fire a second volley, they shrank back
again from the dreadful courage necessary for carrying out
another massacre.&nbsp; Meantime the prisoners, brought the
second time before the magistrates under a strong escort of
soldiers, were the second time remanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strike went on this day also.&nbsp; The
workmen&rsquo;s committees were extended, and gave relief to
great numbers of people, for they had organised a considerable
amount of production of food by men whom they could depend
upon.&nbsp; Quite a number of well-to-do people were now
compelled to seek relief of them.&nbsp; But another curious thing
happened: a band of young men of the upper classes armed
themselves, and coolly went marauding in the streets, taking what
suited them of such eatables and portables that they came across
in the shops which had ventured to open.&nbsp; This operation
they carried out in Oxford Street, then a great street of shops
of all kinds.&nbsp; The Government, being at that hour in one of
their yielding moods, thought this a fine opportunity for showing
their impartiality in the maintenance of &lsquo;order,&rsquo; and
sent to arrest these hungry rich youths; who, however, surprised
the police by a valiant resistance, so that all but three
escaped.&nbsp; The Government did not gain the reputation for
impartiality which they expected from this move; for they forgot
that there were no evening papers; and the account of the
skirmish spread wide indeed, but in a distorted form for it was
mostly told simply as an exploit of the starving people from the
East-end; and everybody thought it was but natural for the
Government to put them down when and where they could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That evening the rebel prisoners were visited in their
cells by <i>very</i> polite and sympathetic persons, who pointed
out to them what a suicidal course they were following, and how
dangerous these extreme courses were for the popular cause.&nbsp;
Says one of the prisoners: &lsquo;It was great sport comparing
notes when we came out anent the attempt of the Government to
&ldquo;get at&rdquo; us separately in prison, and how we answered
the blandishments of the highly &ldquo;intelligent and
refined&rdquo; persons set on to pump us.&nbsp; One laughed;
another told extravagant long-bow stories to the envoy; a third
held a sulky silence; a fourth damned the polite spy and bade him
hold his jaw&mdash;and that was all they got out of
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So passed the second day of the great strike.&nbsp; It
was clear to all thinking people that the third day would bring
on the crisis; for the present suspense and ill-concealed terror
was unendurable.&nbsp; The ruling classes, and the middle-class
non-politicians who had been their real strength and support,
were as sheep lacking a shepherd; they literally did not know
what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing they found they had to do: try to get the
&lsquo;rebels&rsquo; to do something.&nbsp; So the next morning,
the morning of the third day of the strike, when the members of
the Committee of Public Safety appeared again before the
magistrate, they found themselves treated with the greatest
possible courtesy&mdash;in fact, rather as envoys and ambassadors
than prisoners.&nbsp; In short, the magistrate had received his
orders; and with no more to do than might come of a long stupid
speech, which might have been written by Dickens in mockery, he
discharged the prisoners, who went back to their meeting-place
and at once began a due sitting.&nbsp; It was high time.&nbsp;
For this third day the mass was fermenting indeed.&nbsp; There
was, of course, a vast number of working people who were not
organised in the least in the world; men who had been used to act
as their masters drove them, or rather as the system drove, of
which their masters were a part.&nbsp; That system was now
falling to pieces, and the old pressure of the master having been
taken off these poor men, it seemed likely that nothing but the
mere animal necessities and passions of men would have any hold
on them, and that mere general overturn would be the
result.&nbsp; Doubtless this would have happened if it had not
been that the huge mass had been leavened by Socialist opinion in
the first place, and in the second by actual contact with
declared Socialists, many or indeed most of whom were members of
those bodies of workmen above said.</p>
<p>If anything of this kind had happened some years before, when
the masters of labour were still looked upon as the natural
rulers of the people, and even the poorest and most ignorant man
leaned upon them for support, while they submitted to their
fleecing, the entire break-up of all society would have
followed.&nbsp; But the long series of years during which the
workmen had learned to despise their rulers, had done away with
their dependence upon them, and they were now beginning to trust
(somewhat dangerously, as events proved) in the non-legal leaders
whom events had thrust forward; and though most of these were now
become mere figure-heads, their names and reputations were useful
in this crisis as a stop-gap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The effect of the news, therefore, of the release of
the Committee gave the Government some breathing time: for it was
received with the greatest joy by the workers, and even the
well-to-do saw in it a respite from the mere destruction which
they had begun to dread, and the fear of which most of them
attributed to the weakness of the Government.&nbsp; As far as the
passing hour went, perhaps they were right in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;What could
the Government have done?&nbsp; I often used to think that they
would be helpless in such a crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said old Hammond: &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t doubt that in
the long run matters would have come about as they did.&nbsp; But
if the Government could have treated their army as a real army,
and used them strategically as a general would have done, looking
on the people as a mere open enemy to be shot at and dispersed
wherever they turned up, they would probably have gained the
victory at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would the soldiers have acted against the people in
this way?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;I think from all I have heard that they would
have done so if they had met bodies of men armed however badly,
and however badly they had been organised.&nbsp; It seems also as
if before the Trafalgar Square massacre they might as a whole
have been depended upon to fire upon an unarmed crowd, though
they were much honeycombed by Socialism.&nbsp; The reason for
this was that they dreaded the use by apparently unarmed men of
an explosive called dynamite, of which many loud boasts were made
by the workers on the eve of these events; although it turned out
to be of little use as a material for war in the way that was
expected.&nbsp; Of course the officers of the soldiery fanned
this fear to the utmost, so that the rank and file probably
thought on that occasion that they were being led into a
desperate battle with men who were really armed, and whose weapon
was the more dreadful, because it was concealed.&nbsp; After that
massacre, however, it was at all times doubtful if the regular
soldiers would fire upon an unarmed or half-armed
crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;The regular soldiers?&nbsp; Then there were
other combatants against the people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we shall come to that
presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you had better go on
straight with your story.&nbsp; I see that time is
wearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Hammond: &ldquo;The Government lost no time in coming to
terms with the Committee of Public Safety; for indeed they could
think of nothing else than the danger of the moment.&nbsp; They
sent a duly accredited envoy to treat with these men, who somehow
had obtained dominion over people&rsquo;s minds, while the formal
rulers had no hold except over their bodies.&nbsp; There is no
need at present to go into the details of the truce (for such it
was) between these high contracting parties, the Government of
the empire of Great Britain and a handful of working-men (as they
were called in scorn in those days), amongst whom, indeed, were
some very capable and &lsquo;square-headed&rsquo; persons,
though, as aforesaid, the abler men were not then the recognised
leaders.&nbsp; The upshot of it was that all the definite claims
of the people had to be granted.&nbsp; We can now see that most
of these claims were of themselves not worth either demanding or
resisting; but they were looked on at that time as most
important, and they were at least tokens of revolt against the
miserable system of life which was then beginning to tumble to
pieces.&nbsp; One claim, however, was of the utmost immediate
importance, and this the Government tried hard to evade; but as
they were not dealing with fools, they had to yield at
last.&nbsp; This was the claim of recognition and formal status
for the Committee of Public Safety, and all the associations
which it fostered under its wing.&nbsp; This it is clear meant
two things: first, amnesty for &lsquo;the rebels,&rsquo; great
and small, who, without a distinct act of civil war, could no
longer be attacked; and next, a continuance of the organised
revolution.&nbsp; Only one point the Government could gain, and
that was a name.&nbsp; The dreadful revolutionary title was
dropped, and the body, with its branches, acted under the
respectable name of the &lsquo;Board of Conciliation and its
local offices.&rsquo;&nbsp; Carrying this name, it became the
leader of the people in the civil war which soon
followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said I, somewhat startled, &ldquo;so the
civil war went on, in spite of all that had happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;In fact, it was
this very legal recognition which made the civil war possible in
the ordinary sense of war; it took the struggle out of the
element of mere massacres on one side, and endurance plus strikes
on the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can you tell me in what kind of way the war was
carried on?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we have records and to spare
of all that; and the essence of them I can give you in a few
words.&nbsp; As I told you, the rank and file of the army was not
to be trusted by the reactionists; but the officers generally
were prepared for anything, for they were mostly the very
stupidest men in the country.&nbsp; Whatever the Government might
do, a great part of the upper and middle classes were determined
to set on foot a counter revolution; for the Communism which now
loomed ahead seemed quite unendurable to them.&nbsp; Bands of
young men, like the marauders in the great strike of whom I told
you just now, armed themselves and drilled, and began on any
opportunity or pretence to skirmish with the people in the
streets.&nbsp; The Government neither helped them nor put them
down, but stood by, hoping that something might come of it.&nbsp;
These &lsquo;Friends of Order,&rsquo; as they were called, had
some successes at first, and grew bolder; they got many officers
of the regular army to help them, and by their means laid hold of
munitions of war of all kinds.&nbsp; One part of their tactics
consisted in their guarding and even garrisoning the big
factories of the period: they held at one time, for instance, the
whole of that place called Manchester which I spoke of just
now.&nbsp; A sort of irregular war was carried on with varied
success all over the country; and at last the Government, which
at first pretended to ignore the struggle, or treat it as mere
rioting, definitely declared for &lsquo;the Friends of
Order,&rsquo; and joined to their bands whatsoever of the regular
army they could get together, and made a desperate effort to
overwhelm &lsquo;the rebels,&rsquo; as they were now once more
called, and as indeed they called themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was too late.&nbsp; All ideas of peace on a basis of
compromise had disappeared on either side.&nbsp; The end, it was
seen clearly, must be either absolute slavery for all but the
privileged, or a system of life founded on equality and
Communism.&nbsp; The sloth, the hopelessness, and if I may say
so, the cowardice of the last century, had given place to the
eager, restless heroism of a declared revolutionary period.&nbsp;
I will not say that the people of that time foresaw the life we
are leading now, but there was a general instinct amongst them
towards the essential part of that life, and many men saw clearly
beyond the desperate struggle of the day into the peace which it
was to bring about.&nbsp; The men of that day who were on the
side of freedom were not unhappy, I think, though they were
harassed by hopes and fears, and sometimes torn by doubts, and
the conflict of duties hard to reconcile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did the people, the revolutionists, carry on
the war?&nbsp; What were the elements of success on their
side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put this question, because I wanted to bring the old man
back to the definite history, and take him out of the musing mood
so natural to an old man.</p>
<p>He answered: &ldquo;Well, they did not lack organisers; for
the very conflict itself, in days when, as I told you, men of any
strength of mind cast away all consideration for the ordinary
business of life, developed the necessary talent amongst
them.&nbsp; Indeed, from all I have read and heard, I much doubt
whether, without this seemingly dreadful civil war, the due
talent for administration would have been developed amongst the
working men.&nbsp; Anyhow, it was there, and they soon got
leaders far more than equal to the best men amongst the
reactionaries.&nbsp; For the rest, they had no difficulty about
the material of their army; for that revolutionary instinct so
acted on the ordinary soldier in the ranks that the greater part,
certainly the best part, of the soldiers joined the side of the
people.&nbsp; But the main element of their success was this,
that wherever the working people were not coerced, they worked,
not for the reactionists, but for &lsquo;the rebels.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The reactionists could get no work done for them outside the
districts where they were all-powerful: and even in those
districts they were harassed by continual risings; and in all
cases and everywhere got nothing done without obstruction and
black looks and sulkiness; so that not only were their armies
quite worn out with the difficulties which they had to meet, but
the non-combatants who were on their side were so worried and
beset with hatred and a thousand little troubles and annoyances
that life became almost unendurable to them on those terms.&nbsp;
Not a few of them actually died of the worry; many committed
suicide.&nbsp; Of course, a vast number of them joined actively
in the cause of reaction, and found some solace to their misery
in the eagerness of conflict.&nbsp; Lastly, many thousands gave
way and submitted to &lsquo;the rebels&rsquo;; and as the numbers
of these latter increased, it at last became clear to all men
that the cause which was once hopeless, was now triumphant, and
that the hopeless cause was that of slavery and
privilege.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII: THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW LIFE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;so you got clear out of all
your trouble.&nbsp; Were people satisfied with the new order of
things when it came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, surely all
must have been glad of peace when it came; especially when they
found, as they must have found, that after all, they&mdash;even
the once rich&mdash;were not living very badly.&nbsp; As to those
who had been poor, all through the war, which lasted about two
years, their condition had been bettering, in spite of the
struggle; and when peace came at last, in a very short time they
made great strides towards a decent life.&nbsp; The great
difficulty was that the once-poor had such a feeble conception of
the real pleasure of life: so to say, they did not ask enough,
did not know how to ask enough, from the new state of
things.&nbsp; It was perhaps rather a good than an evil thing
that the necessity for restoring the wealth destroyed during the
war forced them into working at first almost as hard as they had
been used to before the Revolution.&nbsp; For all historians are
agreed that there never was a war in which there was so much
destruction of wares, and instruments for making them as in this
civil war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am rather surprised at that,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; said
Hammond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;because the party of order
would surely look upon the wealth as their own property, no share
of which, if they could help it, should go to their slaves,
supposing they conquered.&nbsp; And on the other hand, it was
just for the possession of that wealth that &lsquo;the
rebels&rsquo; were fighting, and I should have thought,
especially when they saw that they were winning, that they would
have been careful to destroy as little as possible of what was so
soon to be their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was as I have told you, however,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;The party of order, when they recovered from
their first cowardice of surprise&mdash;or, if you please, when
they fairly saw that, whatever happened, they would be ruined,
fought with great bitterness, and cared little what they did, so
long as they injured the enemies who had destroyed the sweets of
life for them.&nbsp; As to &lsquo;the rebels,&rsquo; I have told
you that the outbreak of actual war made them careless of trying
to save the wretched scraps of wealth that they had.&nbsp; It was
a common saying amongst them, Let the country be cleared of
everything except valiant living men, rather than that we fall
into slavery again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat silently thinking a little while, and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the conflict was once really begun, it was seen
how little of any value there was in the old world of slavery and
inequality.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see what it means?&nbsp; In the
times which you are thinking of, and of which you seem to know so
much, there was no hope; nothing but the dull jog of the
mill-horse under compulsion of collar and whip; but in that
fighting-time that followed, all was hope: &lsquo;the
rebels&rsquo; at least felt themselves strong enough to build up
the world again from its dry bones,&mdash;and they did it,
too!&rdquo; said the old man, his eyes glittering under his
beetling brows.&nbsp; He went on: &ldquo;And their opponents at
least and at last learned something about the reality of life,
and its sorrows, which they&mdash;their class, I mean&mdash;had
once known nothing of.&nbsp; In short, the two combatants, the
workman and the gentleman, between them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between them,&rdquo; said I, quickly, &ldquo;they
destroyed commercialism!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;that is it.&nbsp;
Nor could it have been destroyed otherwise; except, perhaps, by
the whole of society gradually falling into lower depths, till it
should at last reach a condition as rude as barbarism, but
lacking both the hope and the pleasures of barbarism.&nbsp;
Surely the sharper, shorter remedy was the happiest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most surely,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;the world was
being brought to its second birth; how could that take place
without a tragedy?&nbsp; Moreover, think of it.&nbsp; The spirit
of the new days, of our days, was to be delight in the life of
the world; intense and overweening love of the very skin and
surface of the earth on which man dwells, such as a lover has in
the fair flesh of the woman he loves; this, I say, was to be the
new spirit of the time.&nbsp; All other moods save this had been
exhausted: the unceasing criticism, the boundless curiosity in
the ways and thoughts of man, which was the mood of the ancient
Greek, to whom these things were not so much a means, as an end,
was gone past recovery; nor had there been really any shadow of
it in the so-called science of the nineteenth century, which, as
you must know, was in the main an appendage to the commercial
system; nay, not seldom an appendage to the police of that
system.&nbsp; In spite of appearances, it was limited and
cowardly, because it did not really believe in itself.&nbsp; It
was the outcome, as it was the sole relief, of the unhappiness of
the period which made life so bitter even to the rich, and which,
as you may see with your bodily eyes, the great change has swept
away.&nbsp; More akin to our way of looking at life was the
spirit of the Middle Ages, to whom heaven and the life of the
next world was such a reality, that it became to them a part of
the life upon the earth; which accordingly they loved and
adorned, in spite of the ascetic doctrines of their formal creed,
which bade them contemn it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that also, with its assured belief in heaven and
hell as two countries in which to live, has gone, and now we do,
both in word and in deed, believe in the continuous life of the
world of men, and as it were, add every day of that common life
to the little stock of days which our own mere individual
experience wins for us: and consequently we are happy.&nbsp; Do
you wonder at it?&nbsp; In times past, indeed, men were told to
love their kind, to believe in the religion of humanity, and so
forth.&nbsp; But look you, just in the degree that a man had
elevation of mind and refinement enough to be able to value this
idea, was he repelled by the obvious aspect of the individuals
composing the mass which he was to worship; and he could only
evade that repulsion by making a conventional abstraction of
mankind that had little actual or historical relation to the
race; which to his eyes was divided into blind tyrants on the one
hand and apathetic degraded slaves on the other.&nbsp; But now,
where is the difficulty in accepting the religion of humanity,
when the men and women who go to make up humanity are free,
happy, and energetic at least, and most commonly beautiful of
body also, and surrounded by beautiful things of their own
fashioning, and a nature bettered and not worsened by contact
with mankind?&nbsp; This is what this age of the world has
reserved for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems true,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or ought to be, if
what my eyes have seen is a token of the general life you
lead.&nbsp; Can you now tell me anything of your progress after
the years of the struggle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;I could easily tell you more than you have
time to listen to; but I can at least hint at one of the chief
difficulties which had to be met: and that was, that when men
began to settle down after the war, and their labour had pretty
much filled up the gap in wealth caused by the destruction of
that war, a kind of disappointment seemed coming over us, and the
prophecies of some of the reactionists of past times seemed as if
they would come true, and a dull level of utilitarian comfort be
the end for a while of our aspirations and success.&nbsp; The
loss of the competitive spur to exertion had not, indeed, done
anything to interfere with the necessary production of the
community, but how if it should make men dull by giving them too
much time for thought or idle musing?&nbsp; But, after all, this
dull thunder-cloud only threatened us, and then passed
over.&nbsp; Probably, from what I have told you before, you will
have a guess at the remedy for such a disaster; remembering
always that many of the things which used to be
produced&mdash;slave-wares for the poor and mere wealth-wasting
wares for the rich&mdash;ceased to be made.&nbsp; That remedy
was, in short, the production of what used to be called art, but
which has no name amongst us now, because it has become a
necessary part of the labour of every man who
produces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said I: &ldquo;What! had men any time or opportunity for
cultivating the fine arts amidst the desperate struggle for life
and freedom that you have told me of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Hammond: &ldquo;You must not suppose that the new form of
art was founded chiefly on the memory of the art of the past;
although, strange to say, the civil war was much less destructive
of art than of other things, and though what of art existed under
the old forms, revived in a wonderful way during the latter part
of the struggle, especially as regards music and poetry.&nbsp;
The art or work-pleasure, as one ought to call it, of which I am
now speaking, sprung up almost spontaneously, it seems, from a
kind of instinct amongst people, no longer driven desperately to
painful and terrible over-work, to do the best they could with
the work in hand&mdash;to make it excellent of its kind; and when
that had gone on for a little, a craving for beauty seemed to
awaken in men&rsquo;s minds, and they began rudely and awkwardly
to ornament the wares which they made; and when they had once set
to work at that, it soon began to grow.&nbsp; All this was much
helped by the abolition of the squalor which our immediate
ancestors put up with so coolly; and by the leisurely, but not
stupid, country-life which now grew (as I told you before) to be
common amongst us.&nbsp; Thus at last and by slow degrees we got
pleasure into our work; then we became conscious of that
pleasure, and cultivated it, and took care that we had our fill
of it; and then all was gained, and we were happy.&nbsp; So may
it be for ages and ages!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man fell into a reverie, not altogether without
melancholy I thought; but I would not break it.&nbsp; Suddenly he
started, and said: &ldquo;Well, dear guest, here are come Dick
and Clara to fetch you away, and there is an end of my talk;
which I daresay you will not be sorry for; the long day is coming
to an end, and you will have a pleasant ride back to
Hammersmith.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX: THE DRIVE BACK TO HAMMERSMITH</h2>
<p>I said nothing, for I was not inclined for mere politeness to
him after such very serious talk; but in fact I should liked to
have gone on talking with the older man, who could understand
something at least of my wonted ways of looking at life, whereas,
with the younger people, in spite of all their kindness, I really
was a being from another planet.&nbsp; However, I made the best
of it, and smiled as amiably as I could on the young couple; and
Dick returned the smile by saying, &ldquo;Well, guest, I am glad
to have you again, and to find that you and my kinsman have not
quite talked yourselves into another world; I was half suspecting
as I was listening to the Welshmen yonder that you would
presently be vanishing away from us, and began to picture my
kinsman sitting in the hall staring at nothing and finding that
he had been talking a while past to nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt rather uncomfortable at this speech, for suddenly the
picture of the sordid squabble, the dirty and miserable tragedy
of the life I had left for a while, came before my eyes; and I
had, as it were, a vision of all my longings for rest and peace
in the past, and I loathed the idea of going back to it
again.&nbsp; But the old man chuckled and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Dick.&nbsp; In any case, I have
not been talking to thin air; nor, indeed to this new friend of
ours only.&nbsp; Who knows but I may not have been talking to
many people?&nbsp; For perhaps our guest may some day go back to
the people he has come from, and may take a message from us which
may bear fruit for them, and consequently for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick looked puzzled, and said: &ldquo;Well, gaffer, I do not
quite understand what you mean.&nbsp; All I can say is, that I
hope he will not leave us: for don&rsquo;t you see, he is another
kind of man to what we are used to, and somehow he makes us think
of all kind of things; and already I feel as if I could
understand Dickens the better for having talked with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clara, &ldquo;and I think in a few
months we shall make him look younger; and I should like to see
what he was like with the wrinkles smoothed out of his
face.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think he will look younger after a
little time with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head, and looked earnestly at me, but
did not answer her, and for a moment or two we were all
silent.&nbsp; Then Clara broke out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kinsman, I don&rsquo;t like this: something or another
troubles me, and I feel as if something untoward were going to
happen.&nbsp; You have been talking of past miseries to the
guest, and have been living in past unhappy times, and it is in
the air all round us, and makes us feel as if we were longing for
something that we cannot have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled on her kindly, and said: &ldquo;Well, my
child, if that be so, go and live in the present, and you will
soon shake it off.&rdquo; Then he turned to me, and said:
&ldquo;Do you remember anything like that, guest, in the country
from which you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lovers had turned aside now, and were talking together
softly, and not heeding us; so I said, but in a low voice:
&ldquo;Yes, when I was a happy child on a sunny holiday, and had
everything that I could think of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You remember
just now you twitted me with living in the second childhood of
the world.&nbsp; You will find it a happy world to live in; you
will be happy there&mdash;for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I did not like his scarcely veiled threat, and was
beginning to trouble myself with trying to remember how I had got
amongst this curious people, when the old man called out in a
cheery voice: &ldquo;Now, my children, take your guest away, and
make much of him; for it is your business to make him sleek of
skin and peaceful of mind: he has by no means been as lucky as
you have.&nbsp; Farewell, guest!&rdquo; and he grasped my hand
warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and thank you very much
for all that you have told me.&nbsp; I will come and see you as
soon as I come back to London.&nbsp; May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come by all means&mdash;if
you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be for some time yet,&rdquo; quoth Dick,
in his cheery voice; &ldquo;for when the hay is in up the river,
I shall be for taking him a round through the country between hay
and wheat harvest, to see how our friends live in the north
country.&nbsp; Then in the wheat harvest we shall do a good
stroke of work, I should hope,&mdash;in Wiltshire by preference;
for he will be getting a little hard with all the open-air
living, and I shall be as tough as nails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will take me along, won&rsquo;t you,
Dick?&rdquo; said Clara, laying her pretty hand on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I not?&rdquo; said Dick, somewhat
boisterously.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we will manage to send you to bed
pretty tired every night; and you will look so beautiful with
your neck all brown, and your hands too, and you under your gown
as white as privet, that you will get some of those strange
discontented whims out of your head, my dear.&nbsp; However, our
week&rsquo;s haymaking will do all that for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl reddened very prettily, and not for shame but for
pleasure; and the old man laughed, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guest, I see that you will be as comfortable as need
be; for you need not fear that those two will be too officious
with you: they will be so busy with each other, that they will
leave you a good deal to yourself, I am sure, and that is a real
kindness to a guest, after all.&nbsp; O, you need not be afraid
of being one too many, either: it is just what these birds in a
nest like, to have a good convenient friend to turn to, so that
they may relieve the ecstasies of love with the solid commonplace
of friendship.&nbsp; Besides, Dick, and much more Clara, likes a
little talking at times; and you know lovers do not talk unless
they get into trouble, they only prattle.&nbsp; Good-bye, guest;
may you be happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara went up to old Hammond, threw her arms about his neck
and kissed him heartily, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a dear old man, and may have your jest about me
as much as you please; and it won&rsquo;t be long before we see
you again; and you may be sure we shall make our guest happy;
though, mind you, there is some truth in what you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I shook hands again, and we went out of the hall and into
the cloisters, and so in the street found Greylocks in the shafts
waiting for us.&nbsp; He was well looked after; for a little lad
of about seven years old had his hand on the rein and was
solemnly looking up into his face; on his back, withal, was a
girl of fourteen, holding a three-year old sister on before her;
while another girl, about a year older than the boy, hung on
behind.&nbsp; The three were occupied partly with eating
cherries, partly with patting and punching Greylocks, who took
all their caresses in good part, but pricked up his ears when
Dick made his appearance.&nbsp; The girls got off quietly, and
going up to Clara, made much of her and snuggled up to her.&nbsp;
And then we got into the carriage, Dick shook the reins, and we
got under way at once, Greylocks trotting soberly between the
lovely trees of the London streets, that were sending floods of
fragrance into the cool evening air; for it was now getting
toward sunset.</p>
<p>We could hardly go but fair and softly all the way, as there
were a great many people abroad in that cool hour.&nbsp; Seeing
so many people made me notice their looks the more; and I must
say, my taste, cultivated in the sombre greyness, or rather
brownness, of the nineteenth century, was rather apt to condemn
the gaiety and brightness of the raiment; and I even ventured to
say as much to Clara.&nbsp; She seemed rather surprised, and even
slightly indignant, and said: &ldquo;Well, well, what&rsquo;s the
matter?&nbsp; They are not about any dirty work; they are only
amusing themselves in the fine evening; there is nothing to foul
their clothes.&nbsp; Come, doesn&rsquo;t it all look very
pretty?&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t gaudy, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed that was true; for many of the people were clad in
colours that were sober enough, though beautiful, and the harmony
of the colours was perfect and most delightful.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Yes, that is so; but how can everybody afford
such costly garments?&nbsp; Look! there goes a middle-aged man in
a sober grey dress; but I can see from here that it is made of
very fine woollen stuff, and is covered with silk
embroidery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Clara: &ldquo;He could wear shabby clothes if he
pleased,&mdash;that is, if he didn&rsquo;t think he would hurt
people&rsquo;s feelings by doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But please tell me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how can they
afford it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as I had spoken I perceived that I had got back to my
old blunder; for I saw Dick&rsquo;s shoulders shaking with
laughter; but he wouldn&rsquo;t say a word, but handed me over to
the tender mercies of Clara, who said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&nbsp; Of course
we can afford it, or else we shouldn&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; It
would be easy enough for us to say, we will only spend our labour
on making our clothes comfortable: but we don&rsquo;t choose to
stop there.&nbsp; Why do you find fault with us?&nbsp; Does it
seem to you as if we starved ourselves of food in order to make
ourselves fine clothes?&nbsp; Or do you think there is anything
wrong in liking to see the coverings of our bodies beautiful like
our bodies are?&mdash;just as a deer&rsquo;s or an otter&rsquo;s
skin has been made beautiful from the first?&nbsp; Come, what is
wrong with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed before the storm, and mumbled out some excuse or
other.&nbsp; I must say, I might have known that people who were
so fond of architecture generally, would not be backward in
ornamenting themselves; all the more as the shape of their
raiment, apart from its colour, was both beautiful and
reasonable&mdash;veiling the form, without either muffling or
caricaturing it.</p>
<p>Clara was soon mollified; and as we drove along toward the
wood before mentioned, she said to Dick&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, Dick: now that kinsman Hammond the
Elder has seen our guest in his queer clothes, I think we ought
to find him something decent to put on for our journey to-morrow:
especially since, if we do not, we shall have to answer all sorts
of questions as to his clothes and where they came from.&nbsp;
Besides,&rdquo; she said slily, &ldquo;when he is clad in
handsome garments he will not be so quick to blame us for our
childishness in wasting our time in making ourselves look
pleasant to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Clara,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;he shall
have everything that you&mdash;that he wants to have.&nbsp; I
will look something out for him before he gets up
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX: THE HAMMERSMITH GUEST-HOUSE AGAIN</h2>
<p>Amidst such talk, driving quietly through the balmy evening,
we came to Hammersmith, and were well received by our friends
there.&nbsp; Boffin, in a fresh suit of clothes, welcomed me back
with stately courtesy; the weaver wanted to button-hole me and
get out of me what old Hammond had said, but was very friendly
and cheerful when Dick warned him off; Annie shook hands with me,
and hoped I had had a pleasant day&mdash;so kindly, that I felt a
slight pang as our hands parted; for to say the truth, I liked
her better than Clara, who seemed to be always a little on the
defensive, whereas Annie was as frank as could be, and seemed to
get honest pleasure from everything and everybody about her
without the least effort.</p>
<p>We had quite a little feast that evening, partly in my honour,
and partly, I suspect, though nothing was said about it, in
honour of Dick and Clara coming together again.&nbsp; The wine
was of the best; the hall was redolent of rich summer flowers;
and after supper we not only had music (Annie, to my mind,
surpassing all the others for sweetness and clearness of voice,
as well as for feeling and meaning), but at last we even got to
telling stories, and sat there listening, with no other light but
that of the summer moon streaming through the beautiful traceries
of the windows, as if we had belonged to time long passed, when
books were scarce and the art of reading somewhat rare.&nbsp;
Indeed, I may say here, that, though, as you will have noted, my
friends had mostly something to say about books, yet they were
not great readers, considering the refinement of their manners
and the great amount of leisure which they obviously had.&nbsp;
In fact, when Dick, especially, mentioned a book, he did so with
an air of a man who has accomplished an achievement; as much as
to say, &ldquo;There, you see, I have actually read
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evening passed all too quickly for me; since that day, for
the first time in my life, I was having my fill of the pleasure
of the eyes without any of that sense of incongruity, that dread
of approaching ruin, which had always beset me hitherto when I
had been amongst the beautiful works of art of the past, mingled
with the lovely nature of the present; both of them, in fact, the
result of the long centuries of tradition, which had compelled
men to produce the art, and compelled nature to run into the
mould of the ages.&nbsp; Here I could enjoy everything without an
afterthought of the injustice and miserable toil which made my
leisure; the ignorance and dulness of life which went to make my
keen appreciation of history; the tyranny and the struggle full
of fear and mishap which went to make my romance.&nbsp; The only
weight I had upon my heart was a vague fear as it drew toward
bed-time concerning the place wherein I should wake on the
morrow: but I choked that down, and went to bed happy, and in a
very few moments was in a dreamless sleep.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI: GOING UP THE RIVER</h2>
<p>When I did wake, to a beautiful sunny morning, I leapt out of
bed with my over-night apprehension still clinging to me, which
vanished delightfully however in a moment as I looked around my
little sleeping chamber and saw the pale but pure-coloured
figures painted on the plaster of the wall, with verses written
underneath them which I knew somewhat over well.&nbsp; I dressed
speedily, in a suit of blue laid ready for me, so handsome that I
quite blushed when I had got into it, feeling as I did so that
excited pleasure of anticipation of a holiday, which, well
remembered as it was, I had not felt since I was a boy, new come
home for the summer holidays.</p>
<p>It seemed quite early in the morning, and I expected to have
the hall to myself when I came into it out of the corridor
wherein was my sleeping chamber; but I met Annie at once, who let
fall her broom and gave me a kiss, quite meaningless I fear,
except as betokening friendship, though she reddened as she did
it, not from shyness, but from friendly pleasure, and then stood
and picked up her broom again, and went on with her sweeping,
nodding to me as if to bid me stand out of the way and look on;
which, to say the truth, I thought amusing enough, as there were
five other girls helping her, and their graceful figures engaged
in the leisurely work were worth going a long way to see, and
their merry talk and laughing as they swept in quite a scientific
manner was worth going a long way to hear.&nbsp; But Annie
presently threw me back a word or two as she went on to the other
end of the hall: &ldquo;Guest,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am glad
that you are up early, though we wouldn&rsquo;t disturb you; for
our Thames is a lovely river at half-past six on a June morning:
and as it would be a pity for you to lose it, I am told just to
give you a cup of milk and a bit of bread outside there, and put
you into the boat: for Dick and Clara are all ready now.&nbsp;
Wait half a minute till I have swept down this row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So presently she let her broom drop again, and came and took
me by the hand and led me out on to the terrace above the river,
to a little table under the boughs, where my bread and milk took
the form of as dainty a breakfast as any one could desire, and
then sat by me as I ate.&nbsp; And in a minute or two Dick and
Clara came to me, the latter looking most fresh and beautiful in
a light silk embroidered gown, which to my unused eyes was
extravagantly gay and bright; while Dick was also handsomely
dressed in white flannel prettily embroidered.&nbsp; Clara raised
her gown in her hands as she gave me the morning greeting, and
said laughingly: &ldquo;Look, guest! you see we are at least as
fine as any of the people you felt inclined to scold last night;
you see we are not going to make the bright day and the flowers
feel ashamed of themselves.&nbsp; Now scold me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quoth I: &ldquo;No, indeed; the pair of you seem as if you
were born out of the summer day itself; and I will scold you when
I scold it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;this is a
special day&mdash;all these days are, I mean.&nbsp; The
hay-harvest is in some ways better than corn-harvest because of
the beautiful weather; and really, unless you had worked in the
hay-field in fine weather, you couldn&rsquo;t tell what pleasant
work it is.&nbsp; The women look so pretty at it, too,&rdquo; he
said, shyly; &ldquo;so all things considered, I think we are
right to adorn it in a simple manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the women work at it in silk dresses?&rdquo; said I,
smiling.</p>
<p>Dick was going to answer me soberly; but Clara put her hand
over his mouth, and said, &ldquo;No, no, Dick; not too much
information for him, or I shall think that you are your old
kinsman again.&nbsp; Let him find out for himself: he will not
have long to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; quoth Annie, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make your
description of the picture too fine, or else he will be
disappointed when the curtain is drawn.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
him to be disappointed.&nbsp; But now it&rsquo;s time for you to
be gone, if you are to have the best of the tide, and also of the
sunny morning.&nbsp; Good-bye, guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kissed me in her frank friendly way, and almost took away
from me my desire for the expedition thereby; but I had to get
over that, as it was clear that so delightful a woman would
hardly be without a due lover of her own age.&nbsp; We went down
the steps of the landing stage, and got into a pretty boat, not
too light to hold us and our belongings comfortably, and
handsomely ornamented; and just as we got in, down came Boffin
and the weaver to see us off.&nbsp; The former had now veiled his
splendour in a due suit of working clothes, crowned with a
fantail hat, which he took off, however, to wave us farewell with
his grave old-Spanish-like courtesy.&nbsp; Then Dick pushed off
into the stream, and bent vigorously to his sculls, and
Hammersmith, with its noble trees and beautiful water-side
houses, began to slip away from us.</p>
<p>As we went, I could not help putting beside his promised
picture of the hay-field as it was then the picture of it as I
remembered it, and especially the images of the women engaged in
the work rose up before me: the row of gaunt figures, lean,
flat-breasted, ugly, without a grace of form or face about them;
dressed in wretched skimpy print gowns, and hideous flapping
sun-bonnets, moving their rakes in a listless mechanical
way.&nbsp; How often had that marred the loveliness of the June
day to me; how often had I longed to see the hay-fields peopled
with men and women worthy of the sweet abundance of midsummer, of
its endless wealth of beautiful sights, and delicious sounds and
scents.&nbsp; And now, the world had grown old and wiser, and I
was to see my hope realised at last!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII: HAMPTON COURT AND A PRAISER OF PAST TIMES</h2>
<p>So on we went, Dick rowing in an easy tireless way, and Clara
sitting by my side admiring his manly beauty and heartily
good-natured face, and thinking, I fancy, of nothing else.&nbsp;
As we went higher up the river, there was less difference between
the Thames of that day and Thames as I remembered it; for setting
aside the hideous vulgarity of the cockney villas of the
well-to-do, stockbrokers and other such, which in older time
marred the beauty of the bough-hung banks, even this beginning of
the country Thames was always beautiful; and as we slipped
between the lovely summer greenery, I almost felt my youth come
back to me, and as if I were on one of those water excursions
which I used to enjoy so much in days when I was too happy to
think that there could be much amiss anywhere.</p>
<p>At last we came to a reach of the river where on the left hand
a very pretty little village with some old houses in it came down
to the edge of the water, over which was a ferry; and beyond
these houses the elm-beset meadows ended in a fringe of tall
willows, while on the right hand went the tow-path and a clear
space before a row of trees, which rose up behind huge and
ancient, the ornaments of a great park: but these drew back still
further from the river at the end of the reach to make way for a
little town of quaint and pretty houses, some new, some old,
dominated by the long walls and sharp gables of a great red-brick
pile of building, partly of the latest Gothic, partly of the
court-style of Dutch William, but so blended together by the
bright sun and beautiful surroundings, including the bright blue
river, which it looked down upon, that even amidst the beautiful
buildings of that new happy time it had a strange charm about
it.&nbsp; A great wave of fragrance, amidst which the lime-tree
blossom was clearly to be distinguished, came down to us from its
unseen gardens, as Clara sat up in her place, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Dick, dear, couldn&rsquo;t we stop at Hampton Court
for to-day, and take the guest about the park a little, and show
him those sweet old buildings?&nbsp; Somehow, I suppose because
you have lived so near it, you have seldom taken me to Hampton
Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick rested on his oars a little, and said: &ldquo;Well, well,
Clara, you are lazy to-day.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t feel like
stopping short of Shepperton for the night; suppose we just go
and have our dinner at the Court, and go on again about five
o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so be it; but I should
like the guest to have spent an hour or two in the
Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Park!&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;why, the whole
Thames-side is a park this time of the year; and for my part, I
had rather lie under an elm-tree on the borders of a wheat-field,
with the bees humming about me and the corn-crake crying from
furrow to furrow, than in any park in England.&nbsp;
Besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you want to get on to
your dearly-loved upper Thames, and show your prowess down the
heavy swathes of the mowing grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him fondly, and I could tell that she was seeing
him in her mind&rsquo;s eye showing his splendid form at its best
amidst the rhymed strokes of the scythes; and she looked down at
her own pretty feet with a half sigh, as though she were
contrasting her slight woman&rsquo;s beauty with his man&rsquo;s
beauty; as women will when they are really in love, and are not
spoiled with conventional sentiment.</p>
<p>As for Dick, he looked at her admiringly a while, and then
said at last: &ldquo;Well, Clara, I do wish we were there!&nbsp;
But, hilloa! we are getting back way.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he set to
work sculling again, and in two minutes we were all standing on
the gravelly strand below the bridge, which, as you may imagine,
was no longer the old hideous iron abortion, but a handsome piece
of very solid oak framing.</p>
<p>We went into the Court and straight into the great hall, so
well remembered, where there were tables spread for dinner, and
everything arranged much as in Hammersmith Guest-Hall.&nbsp;
Dinner over, we sauntered through the ancient rooms, where the
pictures and tapestry were still preserved, and nothing was much
changed, except that the people whom we met there had an
indefinable kind of look of being at home and at ease, which
communicated itself to me, so that I felt that the beautiful old
place was mine in the best sense of the word; and my pleasure of
past days seemed to add itself to that of to-day, and filled my
whole soul with content.</p>
<p>Dick (who, in spite of Clara&rsquo;s gibe, knew the place very
well) told me that the beautiful old Tudor rooms, which I
remembered had been the dwellings of the lesser fry of Court
flunkies, were now much used by people coming and going; for,
beautiful as architecture had now become, and although the whole
face of the country had quite recovered its beauty, there was
still a sort of tradition of pleasure and beauty which clung to
that group of buildings, and people thought going to Hampton
Court a necessary summer outing, as they did in the days when
London was so grimy and miserable.&nbsp; We went into some of the
rooms looking into the old garden, and were well received by the
people in them, who got speedily into talk with us, and looked
with politely half-concealed wonder at my strange face.&nbsp;
Besides these birds of passage, and a few regular dwellers in the
place, we saw out in the meadows near the garden, down &ldquo;the
Long Water,&rdquo; as it used to be called, many gay tents with
men, women, and children round about them.&nbsp; As it seemed,
this pleasure-loving people were fond of tent-life, with all its
inconveniences, which, indeed, they turned into pleasure
also.</p>
<p>We left this old friend by the time appointed, and I made some
feeble show of taking the sculls; but Dick repulsed me, not much
to my grief, I must say, as I found I had quite enough to do
between the enjoyment of the beautiful time and my own lazily
blended thoughts.</p>
<p>As to Dick, it was quite right to let him pull, for he was as
strong as a horse, and had the greatest delight in bodily
exercise, whatever it was.&nbsp; We really had some difficulty in
getting him to stop when it was getting rather more than dusk,
and the moon was brightening just as we were off Runnymede.&nbsp;
We landed there, and were looking about for a place whereon to
pitch our tents (for we had brought two with us), when an old man
came up to us, bade us good evening, and asked if we were housed
for that that night; and finding that we were not, bade us home
to his house.&nbsp; Nothing loth, we went with him, and Clara
took his hand in a coaxing way which I noticed she used with old
men; and as we went on our way, made some commonplace remark
about the beauty of the day.&nbsp; The old man stopped short, and
looked at her and said: &ldquo;You really like it
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, looking very much astonished,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perhaps I do.&nbsp; I did,
at any rate, when I was younger; but now I think I should like it
cooler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said nothing, and went on, the night growing about as dark
as it would be; till just at the rise of the hill we came to a
hedge with a gate in it, which the old man unlatched and led us
into a garden, at the end of which we could see a little house,
one of whose little windows was already yellow with
candlelight.&nbsp; We could see even under the doubtful light of
the moon and the last of the western glow that the garden was
stuffed full of flowers; and the fragrance it gave out in the
gathering coolness was so wonderfully sweet, that it seemed the
very heart of the delight of the June dusk; so that we three
stopped instinctively, and Clara gave forth a little sweet
&ldquo;O,&rdquo; like a bird beginning to sing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said the old man, a
little testily, and pulling at her hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no dog; or have you trodden on a thorn and
hurt your foot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, neighbour,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but how
sweet, how sweet it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but do you care
so much for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed out musically, and we followed suit in our gruffer
voices; and then she said: &ldquo;Of course I do, neighbour;
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; quoth the old fellow;
then he added, as if somewhat ashamed of himself: &ldquo;Besides,
you know, when the waters are out and all Runnymede is flooded,
it&rsquo;s none so pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> should like it,&rdquo; quoth Dick.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a jolly sail one would get about here on the floods
on a bright frosty January morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Would</i> you like it?&rdquo; said our host.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t argue with you, neighbour; it
isn&rsquo;t worth while.&nbsp; Come in and have some
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went up a paved path between the roses, and straight into a
very pretty room, panelled and carved, and as clean as a new pin;
but the chief ornament of which was a young woman, light-haired
and grey-eyed, but with her face and hands and bare feet tanned
quite brown with the sun.&nbsp; Though she was very lightly clad,
that was clearly from choice, not from poverty, though these were
the first cottage-dwellers I had come across; for her gown was of
silk, and on her wrists were bracelets that seemed to me of great
value.&nbsp; She was lying on a sheep-skin near the window, but
jumped up as soon as we entered, and when she saw the guests
behind the old man, she clapped her hands and cried out with
pleasure, and when she got us into the middle of the room, fairly
danced round us in delight of our company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;you are pleased,
are you, Ellen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl danced up to him and threw her arms round him, and
said: &ldquo;Yes I am, and so ought you to be
grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I am,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as much as I
can be pleased.&nbsp; Guests, please be seated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed rather strange to us; stranger, I suspect, to my
friends than to me; but Dick took the opportunity of both the
host and his grand-daughter being out of the room to say to me,
softly: &ldquo;A grumbler: there are a few of them still.&nbsp;
Once upon a time, I am told, they were quite a
nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man came in as he spoke and sat down beside us with a
sigh, which, indeed, seemed fetched up as if he wanted us to take
notice of it; but just then the girl came in with the victuals,
and the carle missed his mark, what between our hunger generally
and that I was pretty busy watching the grand-daughter moving
about as beautiful as a picture.</p>
<p>Everything to eat and drink, though it was somewhat different
to what we had had in London, was better than good, but the old
man eyed rather sulkily the chief dish on the table, on which lay
a leash of fine perch, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, perch!&nbsp; I am sorry we can&rsquo;t do
better for you, guests.&nbsp; The time was when we might have had
a good piece of salmon up from London for you; but the times have
grown mean and petty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you might have had it now,&rdquo; said the
girl, giggling, &ldquo;if you had known that they were
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our fault for not bringing it with us,
neighbours,&rdquo; said Dick, good-humouredly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
if the times have grown petty, at any rate the perch
haven&rsquo;t; that fellow in the middle there must have weighed
a good two pounds when he was showing his dark stripes and red
fins to the minnows yonder.&nbsp; And as to the salmon, why,
neighbour, my friend here, who comes from the outlands, was quite
surprised yesterday morning when I told him we had plenty of
salmon at Hammersmith.&nbsp; I am sure I have heard nothing of
the times worsening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked a little uncomfortable.&nbsp; And the old man,
turning to me, said very courteously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I am happy to see a man from over the water;
but I really must appeal to you to say whether on the whole you
are not better off in your country; where I suppose, from what
our guest says, you are brisker and more alive, because you have
not wholly got rid of competition.&nbsp; You see, I have read not
a few books of the past days, and certainly <i>they</i> are much
more alive than those which are written now; and good sound
unlimited competition was the condition under which they were
written,&mdash;if we didn&rsquo;t know that from the record of
history, we should know it from the books themselves.&nbsp; There
is a spirit of adventure in them, and signs of a capacity to
extract good out of evil which our literature quite lacks now;
and I cannot help thinking that our moralists and historians
exaggerate hugely the unhappiness of the past days, in which such
splendid works of imagination and intellect were
produced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara listened to him with restless eyes, as if she were
excited and pleased; Dick knitted his brow and looked still more
uncomfortable, but said nothing.&nbsp; Indeed, the old man
gradually, as he warmed to his subject, dropped his sneering
manner, and both spoke and looked very seriously.&nbsp; But the
girl broke out before I could deliver myself of the answer I was
framing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Books, books! always books, grandfather!&nbsp; When
will you understand that after all it is the world we live in
which interests us; the world of which we are a part, and which
we can never love too much?&nbsp; Look!&rdquo; she said, throwing
open the casement wider and showing us the white light sparkling
between the black shadows of the moonlit garden, through which
ran a little shiver of the summer night-wind, &ldquo;look! these
are our books in these days!&mdash;and these,&rdquo; she said,
stepping lightly up to the two lovers and laying a hand on each
of their shoulders; &ldquo;and the guest there, with his over-sea
knowledge and experience;&mdash;yes, and even you,
grandfather&rdquo; (a smile ran over her face as she spoke),
&ldquo;with all your grumbling and wishing yourself back again in
the good old days,&mdash;in which, as far as I can make out, a
harmless and lazy old man like you would either have pretty
nearly starved, or have had to pay soldiers and people to take
the folk&rsquo;s victuals and clothes and houses away from them
by force.&nbsp; Yes, these are our books; and if we want more,
can we not find work to do in the beautiful buildings that we
raise up all over the country (and I know there was nothing like
them in past times), wherein a man can put forth whatever is in
him, and make his hands set forth his mind and his
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused a little, and I for my part could not help staring
at her, and thinking that if she were a book, the pictures in it
were most lovely.&nbsp; The colour mantled in her delicate
sunburnt cheeks; her grey eyes, light amidst the tan of her face,
kindly looked on us all as she spoke.&nbsp; She paused, and said
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for your books, they were well enough for times when
intelligent people had but little else in which they could take
pleasure, and when they must needs supplement the sordid miseries
of their own lives with imaginations of the lives of other
people.&nbsp; But I say flatly that in spite of all their
cleverness and vigour, and capacity for story-telling, there is
something loathsome about them.&nbsp; Some of them, indeed, do
here and there show some feeling for those whom the history-books
call &lsquo;poor,&rsquo; and of the misery of whose lives we have
some inkling; but presently they give it up, and towards the end
of the story we must be contented to see the hero and heroine
living happily in an island of bliss on other people&rsquo;s
troubles; and that after a long series of sham troubles (or
mostly sham) of their own making, illustrated by dreary
introspective nonsense about their feelings and aspirations, and
all the rest of it; while the world must even then have gone on
its way, and dug and sewed and baked and built and carpentered
round about these useless&mdash;animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said the old man, reverting to his dry
sulky manner again.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s eloquence!&nbsp; I
suppose you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, very emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;now the storm of eloquence
has lulled for a little, suppose you answer my
question?&mdash;that is, if you like, you know,&rdquo; quoth he,
with a sudden access of courtesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What question?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; For I must confess
that Ellen&rsquo;s strange and almost wild beauty had put it out
of my head.</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;First of all (excuse my catechising), is there
competition in life, after the old kind, in the country whence
you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is the rule
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I wondered as I spoke what fresh
complications I should get into as a result of this answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Question two,&rdquo; said the carle: &ldquo;Are you not
on the whole much freer, more energetic&mdash;in a word,
healthier and happier&mdash;for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t talk so if you had
any idea of our life.&nbsp; To me you seem here as if you were
living in heaven compared with us of the country from which I
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven?&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;you like heaven, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I&mdash;snappishly, I am afraid; for I
was beginning rather to resent his formula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am far from sure that I do,&rdquo; quoth
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think one may do more with one&rsquo;s life
than sitting on a damp cloud and singing hymns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was rather nettled by this inconsequence, and said:
&ldquo;Well, neighbour, to be short, and without using metaphors,
in the land whence I come, where the competition which produced
those literary works which you admire so much is still the rule,
most people are thoroughly unhappy; here, to me at least most
people seem thoroughly happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offence, guest&mdash;no offence,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;but let me ask you; you like that, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His formula, put with such obstinate persistence, made us all
laugh heartily; and even the old man joined in the laughter on
the sly.&nbsp; However, he was by no means beaten, and said
presently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From all I can hear, I should judge that a young woman
so beautiful as my dear Ellen yonder would have been a lady, as
they called it in the old time, and wouldn&rsquo;t have had to
wear a few rags of silk as she does now, or to have browned
herself in the sun as she has to do now.&nbsp; What do you say to
that, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Clara, who had been pretty much silent hitherto, struck
in, and said: &ldquo;Well, really, I don&rsquo;t think that you
would have mended matters, or that they want mending.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you see that she is dressed deliciously for this
beautiful weather?&nbsp; And as for the sun-burning of your
hay-fields, why, I hope to pick up some of that for myself when
we get a little higher up the river.&nbsp; Look if I don&rsquo;t
need a little sun on my pasty white skin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she stripped up the sleeve from her arm and laid it beside
Ellen&rsquo;s who was now sitting next her.&nbsp; To say the
truth, it was rather amusing to me to see Clara putting herself
forward as a town-bred fine lady, for she was as well-knit and
clean-skinned a girl as might be met with anywhere at the
best.&nbsp; Dick stroked the beautiful arm rather shyly, and
pulled down the sleeve again, while she blushed at his touch; and
the old man said laughingly: &ldquo;Well, I suppose you <i>do</i>
like that; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen kissed her new friend, and we all sat silent for a
little, till she broke out into a sweet shrill song, and held us
all entranced with the wonder of her clear voice; and the old
grumbler sat looking at her lovingly.&nbsp; The other young
people sang also in due time; and then Ellen showed us to our
beds in small cottage chambers, fragrant and clean as the ideal
of the old pastoral poets; and the pleasure of the evening quite
extinguished my fear of the last night, that I should wake up in
the old miserable world of worn-out pleasures, and hopes that
were half fears.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII: AN EARLY MORNING BY RUNNYMEDE</h2>
<p>Though there were no rough noises to wake me, I could not lie
long abed the next morning, where the world seemed so well awake,
and, despite the old grumbler, so happy; so I got up, and found
that, early as it was, someone had been stirring, since all was
trim and in its place in the little parlour, and the table laid
for the morning meal.&nbsp; Nobody was afoot in the house as
then, however, so I went out a-doors, and after a turn or two
round the superabundant garden, I wandered down over the meadow
to the river-side, where lay our boat, looking quite familiar and
friendly to me.&nbsp; I walked up stream a little, watching the
light mist curling up from the river till the sun gained power to
draw it all away; saw the bleak speckling the water under the
willow boughs, whence the tiny flies they fed on were falling in
myriads; heard the great chub splashing here and there at some
belated moth or other, and felt almost back again in my
boyhood.&nbsp; Then I went back again to the boat, and loitered
there a minute or two, and then walked slowly up the meadow
towards the little house.&nbsp; I noted now that there were four
more houses of about the same size on the slope away from the
river.&nbsp; The meadow in which I was going was not up for hay;
but a row of flake-hurdles ran up the slope not far from me on
each side, and in the field so parted off from ours on the left
they were making hay busily by now, in the simple fashion of the
days when I was a boy.&nbsp; My feet turned that way
instinctively, as I wanted to see how haymakers looked in these
new and better times, and also I rather expected to see Ellen
there.&nbsp; I came to the hurdles and stood looking over into
the hay-field, and was close to the end of the long line of
haymakers who were spreading the low ridges to dry off the night
dew.&nbsp; The majority of these were young women clad much like
Ellen last night, though not mostly in silk, but in light woollen
mostly gaily embroidered; the men being all clad in white flannel
embroidered in bright colours.&nbsp; The meadow looked like a
gigantic tulip-bed because of them.&nbsp; All hands were working
deliberately but well and steadily, though they were as noisy
with merry talk as a grove of autumn starlings.&nbsp; Half a
dozen of them, men and women, came up to me and shook hands, gave
me the sele of the morning, and asked a few questions as to
whence and whither, and wishing me good luck, went back to their
work.&nbsp; Ellen, to my disappointment, was not amongst them,
but presently I saw a light figure come out of the hay-field
higher up the slope, and make for our house; and that was Ellen,
holding a basket in her hand.&nbsp; But before she had come to
the garden gate, out came Dick and Clara, who, after a
minute&rsquo;s pause, came down to meet me, leaving Ellen in the
garden; then we three went down to the boat, talking mere morning
prattle.&nbsp; We stayed there a little, Dick arranging some of
the matters in her, for we had only taken up to the house such
things as we thought the dew might damage; and then we went
toward the house again; but when we came near the garden, Dick
stopped us by laying a hand on my arm and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked, and over the low hedge saw Ellen, shading her eyes
against the sun as she looked toward the hay-field, a light wind
stirring in her tawny hair, her eyes like light jewels amidst her
sunburnt face, which looked as if the warmth of the sun were yet
in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, guest,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t it
all look like one of those very stories out of Grimm that we were
talking about up in Bloomsbury?&nbsp; Here are we two lovers
wandering about the world, and we have come to a fairy garden,
and there is the very fairy herself amidst of it: I wonder what
she will do for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Clara demurely, but not stiffly: &ldquo;Is she a good
fairy, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and according to the
card, she would do better, if it were not for the gnome or
wood-spirit, our grumbling friend of last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We laughed at this; and I said, &ldquo;I hope you see that you
have left me out of the tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp;
You had better consider that you have got the cap of darkness,
and are seeing everything, yourself invisible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That touched me on my weak side of not feeling sure of my
position in this beautiful new country; so in order not to make
matters worse, I held my tongue, and we all went into the garden
and up to the house together.&nbsp; I noticed by the way that
Clara must really rather have felt the contrast between herself
as a town madam and this piece of the summer country that we all
admired so, for she had rather dressed after Ellen that morning
as to thinness and scantiness, and went barefoot also, except for
light sandals.</p>
<p>The old man greeted us kindly in the parlour, and said:
&ldquo;Well, guests, so you have been looking about to search
into the nakedness of the land: I suppose your illusions of last
night have given way a bit before the morning light?&nbsp; Do you
still like, it, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; said I, doggedly; &ldquo;it is one of
the prettiest places on the lower Thames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;so you know the Thames, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reddened, for I saw Dick and Clara looking at me, and
scarcely knew what to say.&nbsp; However, since I had said in our
early intercourse with my Hammersmith friends that I had known
Epping Forest, I thought a hasty generalisation might be better
in avoiding complications than a downright lie; so I
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been in this country before; and I have been on
the Thames in those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the old man, eagerly, &ldquo;so you have
been in this country before.&nbsp; Now really, don&rsquo;t you
<i>find</i> it (apart from all theory, you know) much changed for
the worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I find it much
changed for the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;I fear that you have been
prejudiced by some theory or another.&nbsp; However, of course
the time when you were here before must have been so near our own
days that the deterioration might not be very great: as then we
were, of course, still living under the same customs as we are
now.&nbsp; I was thinking of earlier days than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short,&rdquo; said Clara, &ldquo;you have
<i>theories</i> about the change which has taken
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have facts as well,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look
here! from this hill you can see just four little houses,
including this one.&nbsp; Well, I know for certain that in old
times, even in the summer, when the leaves were thickest, you
could see from the same place six quite big and fine houses; and
higher up the water, garden joined garden right up to Windsor;
and there were big houses in all the gardens.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp;
England was an important place in those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was getting nettled, and said: &ldquo;What you mean is that
you de-cockneyised the place, and sent the damned flunkies
packing, and that everybody can live comfortably and happily, and
not a few damned thieves only, who were centres of vulgarity and
corruption wherever they were, and who, as to this lovely river,
destroyed its beauty morally, and had almost destroyed it
physically, when they were thrown out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence after this outburst, which for the life of
me I could not help, remembering how I had suffered from
cockneyism and its cause on those same waters of old time.&nbsp;
But at last the old man said, quite coolly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear guest, I really don&rsquo;t know what you mean
by either cockneys, or flunkies, or thieves, or damned; or how
only a few people could live happily and comfortably in a wealthy
country.&nbsp; All I can see is that you are angry, and I fear
with me: so if you like we will change the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought this kind and hospitable in him, considering his
obstinacy about his theory; and hastened to say that I did not
mean to be angry, only emphatic.&nbsp; He bowed gravely, and I
thought the storm was over, when suddenly Ellen broke in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather, our guest is reticent from courtesy; but
really what he has in his mind to say to you ought to be said; so
as I know pretty well what it is, I will say it for him: for as
you know, I have been taught these things by people
who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;by the sage of
Bloomsbury, and others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;so you know my old kinsman
Hammond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and other people too, as
my grandfather says, and they have taught me things: and this is
the upshot of it.&nbsp; We live in a little house now, not
because we have nothing grander to do than working in the fields,
but because we please; for if we liked, we could go and live in a
big house amongst pleasant companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grumbled the old man: &ldquo;Just so!&nbsp; As if I would live
amongst those conceited fellows; all of them looking down upon
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled on him kindly, but went on as if he had not
spoken.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the past times, when those big houses of
which grandfather speaks were so plenty, we <i>must</i> have
lived in a cottage whether we had liked it or not; and the said
cottage, instead of having in it everything we want, would have
been bare and empty.&nbsp; We should not have got enough to eat;
our clothes would have been ugly to look at, dirty and
frowsy.&nbsp; You, grandfather, have done no hard work for years
now, but wander about and read your books and have nothing to
worry you; and as for me, I work hard when I like it, because I
like it, and think it does me good, and knits up my muscles, and
makes me prettier to look at, and healthier and happier.&nbsp;
But in those past days you, grandfather, would have had to work
hard after you were old; and would have been always afraid of
having to be shut up in a kind of prison along with other old
men, half-starved and without amusement.&nbsp; And as for me, I
am twenty years old.&nbsp; In those days my middle age would be
beginning now, and in a few years I should be pinched, thin, and
haggard, beset with troubles and miseries, so that no one could
have guessed that I was once a beautiful girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this what you have had in your mind, guest?&rdquo;
said she, the tears in her eyes at thought of the past miseries
of people like herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, much moved; &ldquo;that and
more.&nbsp; Often&mdash;in my country I have seen that wretched
change you have spoken of, from the fresh handsome country lass
to the poor draggle-tailed country woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man sat silent for a little, but presently recovered
himself and took comfort in his old phrase of &ldquo;Well, you
like it so, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;I love life better than
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you do, do you?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
for my part I like reading a good old book with plenty of fun in
it, like Thackeray&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vanity Fair.&rsquo;&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t you write books like that now?&nbsp; Ask that
question of your Bloomsbury sage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing Dick&rsquo;s cheeks reddening a little at this sally,
and noting that silence followed, I thought I had better do
something.&nbsp; So I said: &ldquo;I am only the guest, friends;
but I know you want to show me your river at its best, so
don&rsquo;t you think we had better be moving presently, as it is
certainly going to be a hot day?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV: UP THE THAMES: THE SECOND DAY</h2>
<p>They were not slow to take my hint; and indeed, as to the mere
time of day, it was best for us to be off, as it was past seven
o&rsquo;clock, and the day promised to be very hot.&nbsp; So we
got up and went down to our boat&mdash;Ellen thoughtful and
abstracted; the old man very kind and courteous, as if to make up
for his crabbedness of opinion.&nbsp; Clara was cheerful and
natural, but a little subdued, I thought; and she at least was
not sorry to be gone, and often looked shyly and timidly at Ellen
and her strange wild beauty.&nbsp; So we got into the boat, Dick
saying as he took his place, &ldquo;Well, it <i>is</i> a fine
day!&rdquo; and the old man answering &ldquo;What! you like that,
do you?&rdquo; once more; and presently Dick was sending the bows
swiftly through the slow weed-checked stream.&nbsp; I turned
round as we got into mid-stream, and waving my hand to our hosts,
saw Ellen leaning on the old man&rsquo;s shoulder, and caressing
his healthy apple-red cheek, and quite a keen pang smote me as I
thought how I should never see the beautiful girl again.&nbsp;
Presently I insisted on taking the sculls, and I rowed a good
deal that day; which no doubt accounts for the fact that we got
very late to the place which Dick had aimed at.&nbsp; Clara was
particularly affectionate to Dick, as I noticed from the rowing
thwart; but as for him, he was as frankly kind and merry as ever;
and I was glad to see it, as a man of his temperament could not
have taken her caresses cheerfully and without embarrassment if
he had been at all entangled by the fairy of our last
night&rsquo;s abode.</p>
<p>I need say little about the lovely reaches of the river
here.&nbsp; I duly noted that absence of cockney villas which the
old man had lamented; and I saw with pleasure that my old enemies
the &ldquo;Gothic&rdquo; cast-iron bridges had been replaced by
handsome oak and stone ones.&nbsp; Also the banks of the forest
that we passed through had lost their courtly game-keeperish
trimness, and were as wild and beautiful as need he, though the
trees were clearly well seen to.&nbsp; I thought it best, in
order to get the most direct information, to play the innocent
about Eton and Windsor; but Dick volunteered his knowledge to me
as we lay in Datchet lock about the first.&nbsp; Quoth he:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up yonder are some beautiful old buildings, which were
built for a great college or teaching-place by one of the
medi&aelig;val kings&mdash;Edward the Sixth, I think&rdquo; (I
smiled to myself at his rather natural blunder).&nbsp; &ldquo;He
meant poor people&rsquo;s sons to be taught there what knowledge
was going in his days; but it was a matter of course that in the
times of which you seem to know so much they spoilt whatever good
there was in the founder&rsquo;s intentions.&nbsp; My old kinsman
says that they treated them in a very simple way, and instead of
teaching poor men&rsquo;s sons to know something, they taught
rich men&rsquo;s sons to know nothing.&nbsp; It seems from what
he says that it was a place for the &lsquo;aristocracy&rsquo; (if
you know what that word means; I have been told its meaning) to
get rid of the company of their male children for a great part of
the year.&nbsp; I daresay old Hammond would give you plenty of
information in detail about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it used for now?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the buildings were a good
deal spoilt by the last few generations of aristocrats, who seem
to have had a great hatred against beautiful old buildings, and
indeed all records of past history; but it is still a delightful
place.&nbsp; Of course, we cannot use it quite as the founder
intended, since our ideas about teaching young people are so
changed from the ideas of his time; so it is used now as a
dwelling for people engaged in learning; and folk from round
about come and get taught things that they want to learn; and
there is a great library there of the best books.&nbsp; So that I
don&rsquo;t think that the old dead king would be much hurt if he
were to come to life and see what we are doing there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Clara, laughing, &ldquo;I think he
would miss the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always, my dear,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;for there
are often plenty of boys there, who come to get taught; and
also,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;to learn boating and
swimming.&nbsp; I wish we could stop there: but perhaps we had
better do that coming down the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lock-gates opened as he spoke, and out we went, and
on.&nbsp; And as for Windsor, he said nothing till I lay on my
oars (for I was sculling then) in Clewer reach, and looking up,
said, &ldquo;What is all that building up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he: &ldquo;There, I thought I would wait till you asked,
yourself.&nbsp; That is Windsor Castle: that also I thought I
would keep for you till we come down the water.&nbsp; It looks
fine from here, doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; But a great deal of it
has been built or skinned in the time of the Degradation, and we
wouldn&rsquo;t pull the buildings down, since they were there;
just as with the buildings of the Dung-Market.&nbsp; You know, of
course, that it was the palace of our old medi&aelig;val kings,
and was used later on for the same purpose by the parliamentary
commercial sham-kings, as my old kinsman calls them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I know all that.&nbsp; What
is it used for now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great many people live there,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;as, with all drawbacks, it is a pleasant place; there is
also a well-arranged store of antiquities of various kinds that
have seemed worth keeping&mdash;a museum, it would have been
called in the times you understand so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I drew my sculls through the water at that last word, and
pulled as if I were fleeing from those times which I understood
so well; and we were soon going up the once sorely be-cockneyed
reaches of the river about Maidenhead, which now looked as
pleasant and enjoyable as the up-river reaches.</p>
<p>The morning was now getting on, the morning of a jewel of a
summer day; one of those days which, if they were commoner in
these islands, would make our climate the best of all climates,
without dispute.&nbsp; A light wind blew from the west; the
little clouds that had arisen at about our breakfast time had
seemed to get higher and higher in the heavens; and in spite of
the burning sun we no more longed for rain than we feared
it.&nbsp; Burning as the sun was, there was a fresh feeling in
the air that almost set us a-longing for the rest of the hot
afternoon, and the stretch of blossoming wheat seen from the
shadow of the boughs.&nbsp; No one unburdened with very heavy
anxieties could have felt otherwise than happy that morning: and
it must be said that whatever anxieties might lie beneath the
surface of things, we didn&rsquo;t seem to come across any of
them.</p>
<p>We passed by several fields where haymaking was going on, but
Dick, and especially Clara, were so jealous of our up-river
festival that they would not allow me to have much to say to
them.&nbsp; I could only notice that the people in the fields
looked strong and handsome, both men and women, and that so far
from there being any appearance of sordidness about their attire,
they seemed to be dressed specially for the
occasion,&mdash;lightly, of course, but gaily and with plenty of
adornment.</p>
<p>Both on this day as well as yesterday we had, as you may
think, met and passed and been passed by many craft of one kind
and another.&nbsp; The most part of these were being rowed like
ourselves, or were sailing, in the sort of way that sailing is
managed on the upper reaches of the river; but every now and then
we came on barges, laden with hay or other country produce, or
carrying bricks, lime, timber, and the like, and these were going
on their way without any means of propulsion visible to
me&mdash;just a man at the tiller, with often a friend or two
laughing and talking with him.&nbsp; Dick, seeing on one occasion
this day, that I was looking rather hard on one of these, said:
&ldquo;That is one of our force-barges; it is quite as easy to
work vehicles by force by water as by land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I understood pretty well that these &ldquo;force
vehicles&rdquo; had taken the place of our old steam-power
carrying; but I took good care not to ask any questions about
them, as I knew well enough both that I should never be able to
understand how they were worked, and that in attempting to do so
I should betray myself, or get into some complication impossible
to explain; so I merely said, &ldquo;Yes, of course, I
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went ashore at Bisham, where the remains of the old Abbey
and the Elizabethan house that had been added to them yet
remained, none the worse for many years of careful and
appreciative habitation.&nbsp; The folk of the place, however,
were mostly in the fields that day, both men and women; so we met
only two old men there, and a younger one who had stayed at home
to get on with some literary work, which I imagine we
considerably interrupted.&nbsp; Yet I also think that the
hard-working man who received us was not very sorry for the
interruption.&nbsp; Anyhow, he kept on pressing us to stay over
and over again, till at last we did not get away till the cool of
the evening.</p>
<p>However, that mattered little to us; the nights were light,
for the moon was shining in her third quarter, and it was all one
to Dick whether he sculled or sat quiet in the boat: so we went
away a great pace.&nbsp; The evening sun shone bright on the
remains of the old buildings at Medmenham; close beside which
arose an irregular pile of building which Dick told us was a very
pleasant house; and there were plenty of houses visible on the
wide meadows opposite, under the hill; for, as it seems that the
beauty of Hurley had compelled people to build and live there a
good deal.&nbsp; The sun very low down showed us Henley little
altered in outward aspect from what I remembered it.&nbsp; Actual
daylight failed us as we passed through the lovely reaches of
Wargrave and Shiplake; but the moon rose behind us
presently.&nbsp; I should like to have seen with my eyes what
success the new order of things had had in getting rid of the
sprawling mess with which commercialism had littered the banks of
the wide stream about Reading and Caversham: certainly everything
smelt too deliciously in the early night for there to be any of
the old careless sordidness of so-called manufacture; and in
answer to my question as to what sort of a place Reading was,
Dick answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, a nice town enough in its way; mostly rebuilt within
the last hundred years; and there are a good many houses, as you
can see by the lights just down under the hills yonder.&nbsp; In
fact, it is one of the most populous places on the Thames round
about here.&nbsp; Keep up your spirits, guest! we are close to
our journey&rsquo;s end for the night.&nbsp; I ought to ask your
pardon for not stopping at one of the houses here or higher up;
but a friend, who is living in a very pleasant house in the
Maple-Durham meads, particularly wanted me and Clara to come and
see him on our way up the Thames; and I thought you
wouldn&rsquo;t mind this bit of night travelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He need not have adjured me to keep up my spirits, which were
as high as possible; though the strangeness and excitement of the
happy and quiet life which I saw everywhere around me was, it is
true, a little wearing off, yet a deep content, as different as
possible from languid acquiescence, was taking its place, and I
was, as it were, really new-born.</p>
<p>We landed presently just where I remembered the river making
an elbow to the north towards the ancient house of the Blunts;
with the wide meadows spreading on the right-hand side, and on
the left the long line of beautiful old trees overhanging the
water.&nbsp; As we got out of the boat, I said to Dick&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it the old house we are going to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;though that is standing
still in green old age, and is well inhabited.&nbsp; I see, by
the way, that you know your Thames well.&nbsp; But my friend
Walter Allen, who asked me to stop here, lives in a house, not
very big, which has been built here lately, because these meadows
are so much liked, especially in summer, that there was getting
to be rather too much of tenting on the open field; so the
parishes here about, who rather objected to that, built three
houses between this and Caversham, and quite a large one at
Basildon, a little higher up.&nbsp; Look, yonder are the lights
of Walter Allen&rsquo;s house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we walked over the grass of the meadows under a flood of
moonlight, and soon came to the house, which was low and built
round a quadrangle big enough to get plenty of sunshine in
it.&nbsp; Walter Allen, Dick&rsquo;s friend, was leaning against
the jamb of the doorway waiting for us, and took us into the hall
without overplus of words.&nbsp; There were not many people in
it, as some of the dwellers there were away at the haymaking in
the neighbourhood, and some, as Walter told us, were wandering
about the meadow enjoying the beautiful moonlit night.&nbsp;
Dick&rsquo;s friend looked to be a man of about forty; tall,
black-haired, very kind-looking and thoughtful; but rather to my
surprise there was a shade of melancholy on his face, and he
seemed a little abstracted and inattentive to our chat, in spite
of obvious efforts to listen.</p>
<p>Dick looked on him from time to time, and seemed troubled; and
at last he said: &ldquo;I say, old fellow, if there is anything
the matter which we didn&rsquo;t know of when you wrote to me,
don&rsquo;t you think you had better tell us about it at
once?&nbsp; Or else we shall think we have come here at an
unlucky time, and are not quite wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter turned red, and seemed to have some difficulty in
restraining his tears, but said at last: &ldquo;Of course
everybody here is very glad to see you, Dick, and your friends;
but it is true that we are not at our best, in spite of the fine
weather and the glorious hay-crop.&nbsp; We have had a death
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Dick: &ldquo;Well, you should get over that, neighbour:
such things must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Walter said, &ldquo;but this was a death by
violence, and it seems likely to lead to at least one more; and
somehow it makes us feel rather shy of one another; and to say
the truth, that is one reason why there are so few of us present
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us the story, Walter,&rdquo; said Dick;
&ldquo;perhaps telling it will help you to shake off your
sadness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Walter: &ldquo;Well, I will; and I will make it short
enough, though I daresay it might be spun out into a long one, as
used to be done with such subjects in the old novels.&nbsp; There
is a very charming girl here whom we all like, and whom some of
us do more than like; and she very naturally liked one of us
better than anybody else.&nbsp; And another of us (I won&rsquo;t
name him) got fairly bitten with love-madness, and used to go
about making himself as unpleasant as he could&mdash;not of
malice prepense, of course; so that the girl, who liked him well
enough at first, though she didn&rsquo;t love him, began fairly
to dislike him.&nbsp; Of course, those of us who knew him
best&mdash;myself amongst others&mdash;advised him to go away, as
he was making matters worse and worse for himself every
day.&nbsp; Well, he wouldn&rsquo;t take our advice (that also, I
suppose, was a matter of course), so we had to tell him that he
<i>must</i> go, or the inevitable sending to Coventry would
follow; for his individual trouble had so overmastered him that
we felt that <i>we</i> must go if he did not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took that better than we expected, when something or
other&mdash;an interview with the girl, I think, and some hot
words with the successful lover following close upon it, threw
him quite off his balance; and he got hold of an axe and fell
upon his rival when there was no one by; and in the struggle that
followed the man attacked, hit him an unlucky blow and killed
him.&nbsp; And now the slayer in his turn is so upset that he is
like to kill himself; and if he does, the girl will do as much, I
fear.&nbsp; And all this we could no more help than the
earthquake of the year before last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very unhappy,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;but since
the man is dead, and cannot be brought to life again, and since
the slayer had no malice in him, I cannot for the life of me see
why he shouldn&rsquo;t get over it before long.&nbsp; Besides, it
was the right man that was killed and not the wrong.&nbsp; Why
should a man brood over a mere accident for ever?&nbsp; And the
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to her,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;the whole thing
seems to have inspired her with terror rather than grief.&nbsp;
What you say about the man is true, or it should be; but then,
you see, the excitement and jealousy that was the prelude to this
tragedy had made an evil and feverish element round about him,
from which he does not seem to be able to escape.&nbsp; However,
we have advised him to go away&mdash;in fact, to cross the seas;
but he is in such a state that I do not think he <i>can</i> go
unless someone <i>takes</i> him, and I think it will fall to my
lot to do so; which is scarcely a cheerful outlook for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you will find a certain kind of interest in
it,&rdquo; said Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;And of course he <i>must</i>
soon look upon the affair from a reasonable point of view sooner
or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate,&rdquo; quoth Walter, &ldquo;now that
I have eased my mind by making you uncomfortable, let us have an
end of the subject for the present.&nbsp; Are you going to take
your guest to Oxford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course we must pass through it,&rdquo; said
Dick, smiling, &ldquo;as we are going into the upper waters: but
I thought that we wouldn&rsquo;t stop there, or we shall be
belated as to the haymaking up our way.&nbsp; So Oxford and my
learned lecture on it, all got at second-hand from my old
kinsman, must wait till we come down the water a fortnight
hence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I listened to this story with much surprise, and could not
help wondering at first that the man who had slain the other had
not been put in custody till it could be proved that he killed
his rival in self-defence only.&nbsp; However, the more I thought
of it, the plainer it grew to me that no amount of examination of
witnesses, who had witnessed nothing but the ill-blood between
the two rivals, would have done anything to clear up the
case.&nbsp; I could not help thinking, also, that the remorse of
this homicide gave point to what old Hammond had said to me about
the way in which this strange people dealt with what I had been
used to hear called crimes.&nbsp; Truly, the remorse was
exaggerated; but it was quite clear that the slayer took the
whole consequences of the act upon himself, and did not expect
society to whitewash him by punishing him.&nbsp; I had no fear
any longer that &ldquo;the sacredness of human life&rdquo; was
likely to suffer amongst my friends from the absence of gallows
and prison.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV: THE THIRD DAY ON THE THAMES</h2>
<p>As we went down to the boat next morning, Walter could not
quite keep off the subject of last night, though he was more
hopeful than he had been then, and seemed to think that if the
unlucky homicide could not be got to go over-sea, he might at any
rate go and live somewhere in the neighbourhood pretty much by
himself; at any rate, that was what he himself had
proposed.&nbsp; To Dick, and I must say to me also, this seemed a
strange remedy; and Dick said as much.&nbsp; Quoth he:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend Walter, don&rsquo;t set the man brooding on the
tragedy by letting him live alone.&nbsp; That will only
strengthen his idea that he has committed a crime, and you will
have him killing himself in good earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Clara: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; If I may say what
I think of it, it is that he had better have his fill of gloom
now, and, so to say, wake up presently to see how little need
there has been for it; and then he will live happily
afterwards.&nbsp; As for his killing himself, you need not be
afraid of that; for, from all you tell me, he is really very much
in love with the woman; and to speak plainly, until his love is
satisfied, he will not only stick to life as tightly as he can,
but will also make the most of every event of his
life&mdash;will, so to say, hug himself up in it; and I think
that this is the real explanation of his taking the whole matter
with such an excess of tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter looked thoughtful, and said: &ldquo;Well, you may be
right; and perhaps we should have treated it all more lightly:
but you see, guest&rdquo; (turning to me), &ldquo;such things
happen so seldom, that when they do happen, we cannot help being
much taken up with it.&nbsp; For the rest, we are all inclined,
to excuse our poor friend for making us so unhappy, on the ground
that he does it out of an exaggerated respect for human life and
its happiness.&nbsp; Well, I will say no more about it; only
this: will you give me a cast up stream, as I want to look after
a lonely habitation for the poor fellow, since he will have it
so, and I hear that there is one which would suit us very well on
the downs beyond Streatley; so if you will put me ashore there I
will walk up the hill and look to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the house in question empty?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;but the man who lives
there will go out of it, of course, when he hears that we want
it.&nbsp; You see, we think that the fresh air of the downs and
the very emptiness of the landscape will do our friend
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clara, smiling, &ldquo;and he will not
be so far from his beloved that they cannot easily meet if they
have a mind to&mdash;as they certainly will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This talk had brought us down to the boat, and we were
presently afloat on the beautiful broad stream, Dick driving the
prow swiftly through the windless water of the early summer
morning, for it was not yet six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; We were at
the lock in a very little time; and as we lay rising and rising
on the in-coming water, I could not help wondering that my old
friend the pound-lock, and that of the very simplest and most
rural kind, should hold its place there; so I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been wondering, as we passed lock after lock,
that you people, so prosperous as you are, and especially since
you are so anxious for pleasant work to do, have not invented
something which would get rid of this clumsy business of going
up-stairs by means of these rude contrivances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;as long as water has the clumsy habit of running down
hill, I fear we must humour it by going up-stairs when we have
our faces turned from the sea.&nbsp; And really I don&rsquo;t see
why you should fall foul of Maple-Durham lock, which I think a
very pretty place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no doubt about the latter assertion, I thought, as I
looked up at the overhanging boughs of the great trees, with the
sun coming glittering through the leaves, and listened to the
song of the summer blackbirds as it mingled with the sound of the
backwater near us.&nbsp; So not being able to say why I wanted
the locks away&mdash;which, indeed, I didn&rsquo;t do at
all&mdash;I held my peace.&nbsp; But Walter said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, guest, this is not an age of inventions.&nbsp;
The last epoch did all that for us, and we are now content to use
such of its inventions as we find handy, and leaving those alone
which we don&rsquo;t want.&nbsp; I believe, as a matter of fact,
that some time ago (I can&rsquo;t give you a date) some elaborate
machinery was used for the locks, though people did not go so far
as try to make the water run up hill.&nbsp; However, it was
troublesome, I suppose, and the simple hatches, and the gates,
with a big counterpoising beam, were found to answer every
purpose, and were easily mended when wanted with material always
to hand: so here they are, as you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;this kind of lock is
pretty, as you can see; and I can&rsquo;t help thinking that your
machine-lock, winding up like a watch, would have been ugly and
would have spoiled the look of the river: and that is surely
reason enough for keeping such locks as these.&nbsp; Good-bye,
old fellow!&rdquo; said he to the lock, as he pushed us out
through the now open gates by a vigorous stroke of the
boat-hook.&nbsp; &ldquo;May you live long, and have your green
old age renewed for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On we went; and the water had the familiar aspect to me of the
days before Pangbourne had been thoroughly cocknified, as I have
seen it.&nbsp; It (Pangbourne) was distinctly a village
still&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a definite group of houses, and as
pretty as might be.&nbsp; The beech-woods still covered the hill
that rose above Basildon; but the flat fields beneath them were
much more populous than I remembered them, as there were five
large houses in sight, very carefully designed so as not to hurt
the character of the country.&nbsp; Down on the green lip of the
river, just where the water turns toward the Goring and Streatley
reaches, were half a dozen girls playing about on the
grass.&nbsp; They hailed us as we were about passing them, as
they noted that we were travellers, and we stopped a minute to
talk with them.&nbsp; They had been bathing, and were light clad
and bare-footed, and were bound for the meadows on the Berkshire
side, where the haymaking had begun, and were passing the time
merrily enough till the Berkshire folk came in their punt to
fetch them.&nbsp; At first nothing would content them but we must
go with them into the hay-field, and breakfast with them; but
Dick put forward his theory of beginning the hay-harvest higher
up the water, and not spoiling my pleasure therein by giving me a
taste of it elsewhere, and they gave way, though
unwillingly.&nbsp; In revenge they asked me a great many
questions about the country I came from and the manners of life
there, which I found rather puzzling to answer; and doubtless
what answers I did give were puzzling enough to them.&nbsp; I
noticed both with these pretty girls and with everybody else we
met, that in default of serious news, such as we had heard at
Maple-Durham, they were eager to discuss all the little details
of life: the weather, the hay-crop, the last new house, the
plenty or lack of such and such birds, and so on; and they talked
of these things not in a fatuous and conventional way, but as
taking, I say, real interest in them.&nbsp; Moreover, I found
that the women knew as much about all these things as the men:
could name a flower, and knew its qualities; could tell you the
habitat of such and such birds and fish, and the like.</p>
<p>It is almost strange what a difference this intelligence made
in my estimate of the country life of that day; for it used to be
said in past times, and on the whole truly, that outside their
daily work country people knew little of the country, and at
least could tell you nothing about it; while here were these
people as eager about all the goings on in the fields and woods
and downs as if they had been Cockneys newly escaped from the
tyranny of bricks and mortar.</p>
<p>I may mention as a detail worth noticing that not only did
there seem to be a great many more birds about of the
non-predatory kinds, but their enemies the birds of prey were
also commoner.&nbsp; A kite hung over our heads as we passed
Medmenham yesterday; magpies were quite common in the hedgerows;
I saw several sparrow-hawks, and I think a merlin; and now just
as we were passing the pretty bridge which had taken the place of
Basildon railway-bridge, a couple of ravens croaked above our
boat, as they sailed off to the higher ground of the downs.&nbsp;
I concluded from all this that the days of the gamekeeper were
over, and did not even need to ask Dick a question about it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI: THE OBSTINATE REFUSERS</h2>
<p>Before we parted from these girls we saw two sturdy young men
and a woman putting off from the Berkshire shore, and then Dick
bethought him of a little banter of the girls, and asked them how
it was that there was nobody of the male kind to go with them
across the water, and where their boats were gone to.&nbsp; Said
one, the youngest of the party: &ldquo;O, they have got the big
punt to lead stone from up the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you mean by &lsquo;they,&rsquo; dear
child?&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>Said an older girl, laughing: &ldquo;You had better go and see
them.&nbsp; Look there,&rdquo; and she pointed northwest,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see building going on there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;and I am rather surprised
at this time of the year; why are they not haymaking with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls all laughed at this, and before their laugh was
over, the Berkshire boat had run on to the grass and the girls
stepped in lightly, still sniggering, while the new comers gave
us the sele of the day.&nbsp; But before they were under way
again, the tall girl said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse us for laughing, dear neighbours, but we have
had some friendly bickering with the builders up yonder, and as
we have no time to tell you the story, you had better go and ask
them: they will be glad to see you&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t
hinder their work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed again at that, and waved us a pretty farewell
as the punters set them over toward the other shore, and left us
standing on the bank beside our boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go and see them,&rdquo; said Clara; &ldquo;that
is, if you are not in a hurry to get to Streatley,
Walter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;I shall be glad of the
excuse to have a little more of your company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we left the boat moored there, and went on up the slow
slope of the hill; but I said to Dick on the way, being somewhat
mystified: &ldquo;What was all that laughing about? what was the
joke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can guess pretty well,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;some
of them up there have got a piece of work which interests them,
and they won&rsquo;t go to the haymaking, which doesn&rsquo;t
matter at all, because there are plenty of people to do such
easy-hard work as that; only, since haymaking is a regular
festival, the neighbours find it amusing to jeer good-humouredly
at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;much as if in
Dickens&rsquo;s time some young people were so wrapped up in
their work that they wouldn&rsquo;t keep Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;only these people
need not be young either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did you mean by easy-hard work?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>Quoth Dick: &ldquo;Did I say that?&nbsp; I mean work that
tries the muscles and hardens them and sends you pleasantly weary
to bed, but which isn&rsquo;t trying in other ways: doesn&rsquo;t
harass you in short.&nbsp; Such work is always pleasant if you
don&rsquo;t overdo it.&nbsp; Only, mind you, good mowing requires
some little skill.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a pretty good
mower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This talk brought us up to the house that was a-building, not
a large one, which stood at the end of a beautiful orchard
surrounded by an old stone wall.&nbsp; &ldquo;O yes, I
see,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;I remember, a beautiful place for a
house: but a starveling of a nineteenth century house stood
there: I am glad they are rebuilding: it&rsquo;s all stone, too,
though it need not have been in this part of the country: my
word, though, they are making a neat job of it: but I
wouldn&rsquo;t have made it all ashlar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter and Clara were already talking to a tall man clad in
his mason&rsquo;s blouse, who looked about forty, but was I
daresay older, who had his mallet and chisel in hand; there were
at work in the shed and on the scaffold about half a dozen men
and two women, blouse-clad like the carles, while a very pretty
woman who was not in the work but was dressed in an elegant suit
of blue linen came sauntering up to us with her knitting in her
hand.&nbsp; She welcomed us and said, smiling: &ldquo;So you are
come up from the water to see the Obstinate Refusers: where are
you going haymaking, neighbours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, right up above Oxford,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;it
is rather a late country.&nbsp; But what share have you got with
the Refusers, pretty neighbour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said she, with a laugh: &ldquo;O, I am the lucky one who
doesn&rsquo;t want to work; though sometimes I get it, for I
serve as model to Mistress Philippa there when she wants one: she
is our head carver; come and see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led us up to the door of the unfinished house, where a
rather little woman was working with mallet and chisel on the
wall near by.&nbsp; She seemed very intent on what she was doing,
and did not turn round when we came up; but a taller woman, quite
a girl she seemed, who was at work near by, had already knocked
off, and was standing looking from Clara to Dick with delighted
eyes.&nbsp; None of the others paid much heed to us.</p>
<p>The blue-clad girl laid her hand on the carver&rsquo;s
shoulder and said: &ldquo;Now Philippa, if you gobble up your
work like that, you will soon have none to do; and what will
become of you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carver turned round hurriedly and showed us the face of a
woman of forty (or so she seemed), and said rather pettishly, but
in a sweet voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, Kate, and don&rsquo;t
interrupt me if you can help it.&rdquo;&nbsp; She stopped short
when she saw us, then went on with the kind smile of welcome
which never failed us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you for coming to see
us, neighbours; but I am sure that you won&rsquo;t think me
unkind if I go on with my work, especially when I tell you that I
was ill and unable to do anything all through April and May; and
this open-air and the sun and the work together, and my feeling
well again too, make a mere delight of every hour to me; and
excuse me, I must go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fell to work accordingly on a carving in low relief of
flowers and figures, but talked on amidst her mallet strokes:
&ldquo;You see, we all think this the prettiest place for a house
up and down these reaches; and the site has been so long
encumbered with an unworthy one, that we masons were determined
to pay off fate and destiny for once, and build the prettiest
house we could compass here&mdash;and so&mdash;and
so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she lapsed into mere carving, but the tall foreman came
up and said: &ldquo;Yes, neighbours, that is it: so it is going
to be all ashlar because we want to carve a kind of a wreath of
flowers and figures all round it; and we have been much hindered
by one thing or other&mdash;Philippa&rsquo;s illness amongst
others,&mdash;and though we could have managed our wreath without
her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you, though?&rdquo; grumbled the last-named from
the face of the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate, she is our best carver, and it would
not have been kind to begin the carving without her.&nbsp; So you
see,&rdquo; said he, looking at Dick and me, &ldquo;we really
couldn&rsquo;t go haymaking, could we, neighbours?&nbsp; But you
see, we are getting on so fast now with this splendid weather,
that I think we may well spare a week or ten days at
wheat-harvest; and won&rsquo;t we go at that work then!&nbsp;
Come down then to the acres that lie north and by west here at
our backs and you shall see good harvesters, neighbours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, for a good brag!&rdquo; called a voice from the
scaffold above us; &ldquo;our foreman thinks that an easier job
than putting one stone on another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general laugh at this sally, in which the tall
foreman joined; and with that we saw a lad bringing out a little
table into the shadow of the stone-shed, which he set down there,
and then going back, came out again with the inevitable big
wickered flask and tall glasses, whereon the foreman led us up to
due seats on blocks of stone, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, neighbours, drink to my brag coming true, or I
shall think you don&rsquo;t believe me!&nbsp; Up there!&rdquo;
said he, hailing the scaffold, &ldquo;are you coming down for a
glass?&rdquo;&nbsp; Three of the workmen came running down the
ladder as men with good &ldquo;building legs&rdquo; will do; but
the others didn&rsquo;t answer, except the joker (if he must so
be called), who called out without turning round: &ldquo;Excuse
me, neighbours for not getting down.&nbsp; I must get on: my work
is not superintending, like the gaffer&rsquo;s yonder; but, you
fellows, send us up a glass to drink the haymakers&rsquo;
health.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, Philippa would not turn away from
her beloved work; but the other woman carver came; she turned out
to be Philippa&rsquo;s daughter, but was a tall strong girl,
black-haired and gipsey-like of face and curiously solemn of
manner.&nbsp; The rest gathered round us and clinked glasses, and
the men on the scaffold turned about and drank to our healths;
but the busy little woman by the door would have none of it all,
but only shrugged her shoulders when her daughter came up to her
and touched her.</p>
<p>So we shook hands and turned our backs on the Obstinate
Refusers, went down the slope to our boat, and before we had gone
many steps heard the full tune of tinkling trowels mingle with
the humming of the bees and the singing of the larks above the
little plain of Basildon.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII: THE UPPER WATERS</h2>
<p>We set Walter ashore on the Berkshire side, amidst all the
beauties of Streatley, and so went our ways into what once would
have been the deeper country under the foot-hills of the White
Horse; and though the contrast between half-cocknified and wholly
unsophisticated country existed no longer, a feeling of
exultation rose within me (as it used to do) at sight of the
familiar and still unchanged hills of the Berkshire range.</p>
<p>We stopped at Wallingford for our mid-day meal; of course, all
signs of squalor and poverty had disappeared from the streets of
the ancient town, and many ugly houses had been taken down and
many pretty new ones built, but I thought it curious, that the
town still looked like the old place I remembered so well; for
indeed it looked like that ought to have looked.</p>
<p>At dinner we fell in with an old, but very bright and
intelligent man, who seemed in a country way to be another
edition of old Hammond.&nbsp; He had an extraordinary detailed
knowledge of the ancient history of the country-side from the
time of Alfred to the days of the Parliamentary Wars, many events
of which, as you may know, were enacted round about
Wallingford.&nbsp; But, what was more interesting to us, he had
detailed record of the period of the change to the present state
of things, and told us a great deal about it, and especially of
that exodus of the people from the town to the country, and the
gradual recovery by the town-bred people on one side, and the
country-bred people on the other, of those arts of life which
they had each lost; which loss, as he told us, had at one time
gone so far that not only was it impossible to find a carpenter
or a smith in a village or small country town, but that people in
such places had even forgotten how to bake bread, and that at
Wallingford, for instance, the bread came down with the
newspapers by an early train from London, worked in some way, the
explanation of which I could not understand.&nbsp; He told us
also that the townspeople who came into the country used to pick
up the agricultural arts by carefully watching the way in which
the machines worked, gathering an idea of handicraft from
machinery; because at that time almost everything in and about
the fields was done by elaborate machines used quite
unintelligently by the labourers.&nbsp; On the other hand, the
old men amongst the labourers managed to teach the younger ones
gradually a little artizanship, such as the use of the saw and
the plane, the work of the smithy, and so forth; for once more,
by that time it was as much as&mdash;or rather, more than&mdash;a
man could do to fix an ash pole to a rake by handiwork; so that
it would take a machine worth a thousand pounds, a group of
workmen, and half a day&rsquo;s travelling, to do five
shillings&rsquo; worth of work.&nbsp; He showed us, among other
things, an account of a certain village council who were working
hard at all this business; and the record of their intense
earnestness in getting to the bottom of some matter which in time
past would have been thought quite trivial, as, for example, the
due proportions of alkali and oil for soap-making for the village
wash, or the exact heat of the water into which a leg of mutton
should be plunged for boiling&mdash;all this joined to the utter
absence of anything like party feeling, which even in a village
assembly would certainly have made its appearance in an earlier
epoch, was very amusing, and at the same time instructive.</p>
<p>This old man, whose name was Henry Morsom, took us, after our
meal and a rest, into a biggish hall which contained a large
collection of articles of manufacture and art from the last days
of the machine period to that day; and he went over them with us,
and explained them with great care.&nbsp; They also were very
interesting, showing the transition from the makeshift work of
the machines (which was at about its worst a little after the
Civil War before told of) into the first years of the new
handicraft period.&nbsp; Of course, there was much overlapping of
the periods: and at first the new handwork came in very
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must remember,&rdquo; said the old antiquary,
&ldquo;that the handicraft was not the result of what used to be
called material necessity: on the contrary, by that time the
machines had been so much improved that almost all necessary work
might have been done by them: and indeed many people at that
time, and before it, used to think that machinery would entirely
supersede handicraft; which certainly, on the face of it, seemed
more than likely.&nbsp; But there was another opinion, far less
logical, prevalent amongst the rich people before the days of
freedom, which did not die out at once after that epoch had
begun.&nbsp; This opinion, which from all I can learn seemed as
natural then, as it seems absurd now, was, that while the
ordinary daily work of the world would be done entirely by
automatic machinery, the energies of the more intelligent part of
mankind would be set free to follow the higher forms of the arts,
as well as science and the study of history.&nbsp; It was
strange, was it not, that they should thus ignore that aspiration
after complete equality which we now recognise as the bond of all
happy human society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not answer, but thought the more.&nbsp; Dick looked
thoughtful, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange, neighbour?&nbsp; Well, I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; I have often heard my old kinsman say the one aim of
all people before our time was to avoid work, or at least they
thought it was; so of course the work which their daily life
forced them to do, seemed more like work than that which they
seemed to choose for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; said Morsom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyhow,
they soon began to find out their mistake, and that only slaves
and slave-holders could live solely by setting machines
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara broke in here, flushing a little as she spoke:
&ldquo;Was not their mistake once more bred of the life of
slavery that they had been living?&mdash;a life which was always
looking upon everything, except mankind, animate and
inanimate&mdash;&lsquo;nature,&rsquo; as people used to call
it&mdash;as one thing, and mankind as another, it was natural to
people thinking in this way, that they should try to make
&lsquo;nature&rsquo; their slave, since they thought
&lsquo;nature&rsquo; was something outside them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Morsom; &ldquo;and they were
puzzled as to what to do, till they found the feeling against a
mechanical life, which had begun before the Great Change amongst
people who had leisure to think of such things, was spreading
insensibly; till at last under the guise of pleasure that was not
supposed to be work, work that was pleasure began to push out the
mechanical toil, which they had once hoped at the best to reduce
to narrow limits indeed, but never to get rid of; and which,
moreover, they found they could not limit as they had hoped to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did this new revolution gather head?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the half-century that followed the Great
Change,&rdquo; said Morsom, &ldquo;it began to be noteworthy;
machine after machine was quietly dropped under the excuse that
the machines could not produce works of art, and that works of
art were more and more called for.&nbsp; Look here,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;here are some of the works of that time&mdash;rough
and unskilful in handiwork, but solid and showing some sense of
pleasure in the making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are very curious,&rdquo; said I, taking up a piece
of pottery from amongst the specimens which the antiquary was
showing us; &ldquo;not a bit like the work of either savages or
barbarians, and yet with what would once have been called a
hatred of civilisation impressed upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Morsom, &ldquo;you must not look for
delicacy there: in that period you could only have got that from
a man who was practically a slave.&nbsp; But now, you see,&rdquo;
said he, leading me on a little, &ldquo;we have learned the trick
of handicraft, and have added the utmost refinement of
workmanship to the freedom of fancy and imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked, and wondered indeed at the deftness and abundance of
beauty of the work of men who had at last learned to accept life
itself as a pleasure, and the satisfaction of the common needs of
mankind and the preparation for them, as work fit for the best of
the race.&nbsp; I mused silently; but at last I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to come after this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;we will meet it when it comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,&rdquo; quoth Dick, &ldquo;we have got to
meet the rest of our day&rsquo;s journey; so out into the street
and down to the strand!&nbsp; Will you come a turn with us,
neighbour?&nbsp; Our friend is greedy of your stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go as far as Oxford with you,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;I want a book or two out of the Bodleian Library.&nbsp; I
suppose you will sleep in the old city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;we are going higher up;
the hay is waiting us there, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morsom nodded, and we all went into the street together, and
got into the boat a little above the town bridge.&nbsp; But just
as Dick was getting the sculls into the rowlocks, the bows of
another boat came thrusting through the low arch.&nbsp; Even at
first sight it was a gay little craft indeed&mdash;bright green,
and painted over with elegantly drawn flowers.&nbsp; As it
cleared the arch, a figure as bright and gay-clad as the boat
rose up in it; a slim girl dressed in light blue silk that
fluttered in the draughty wind of the bridge.&nbsp; I thought I
knew the figure, and sure enough, as she turned her head to us,
and showed her beautiful face, I saw with joy that it was none
other than the fairy godmother from the abundant garden on
Runnymede&mdash;Ellen, to wit.</p>
<p>We all stopped to receive her.&nbsp; Dick rose in the boat and
cried out a genial good morrow; I tried to be as genial as Dick,
but failed; Clara waved a delicate hand to her; and Morsom nodded
and looked on with interest.&nbsp; As to Ellen, the beautiful
brown of her face was deepened by a flush, as she brought the
gunwale of her boat alongside ours, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, neighbours, I had some doubt if you would all
three come back past Runnymede, or if you did, whether you would
stop there; and besides, I am not sure whether we&mdash;my father
and I&mdash;shall not be away in a week or two, for he wants to
see a brother of his in the north country, and I should not like
him to go without me.&nbsp; So I thought I might never see you
again, and that seemed uncomfortable to me, and&mdash;and so I
came after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I am sure we are all
very glad of that; although you may be sure that as for Clara and
me, we should have made a point of coming to see you, and of
coming the second time, if we had found you away the first.&nbsp;
But, dear neighbour, there you are alone in the boat, and you
have been sculling pretty hard I should think, and might find a
little quiet sitting pleasant; so we had better part our company
into two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;I thought you would do
that, so I have brought a rudder for my boat: will you help me to
ship it, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she went aft in her boat and pushed along our side till
she had brought the stern close to Dick&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; He
knelt down in our boat and she in hers, and the usual fumbling
took place over hanging the rudder on its hooks; for, as you may
imagine, no change had taken place in the arrangement of such an
unimportant matter as the rudder of a pleasure-boat.&nbsp; As the
two beautiful young faces bent over the rudder, they seemed to me
to be very close together, and though it only lasted a moment, a
sort of pang shot through me as I looked on.&nbsp; Clara sat in
her place and did not look round, but presently she said, with
just the least stiffness in her tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall we divide?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you go into
Ellen&rsquo;s boat, Dick, since, without offence to our guest,
you are the better sculler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick stood up and laid his hand on her shoulder, and said:
&ldquo;No, no; let Guest try what he can do&mdash;he ought to be
getting into training now.&nbsp; Besides, we are in no hurry: we
are not going far above Oxford; and even if we are benighted, we
shall have the moon, which will give us nothing worse of a night
than a greyer day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I may manage to do a
little more with my sculling than merely keeping the boat from
drifting down stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed at this, as if it had a been very good joke;
and I thought that Ellen&rsquo;s laugh, even amongst the others,
was one of the pleasantest sounds I had ever heard.</p>
<p>To be short, I got into the new-come boat, not a little
elated, and taking the sculls, set to work to show off a
little.&nbsp; For&mdash;must I say it?&mdash;I felt as if even
that happy world were made the happier for my being so near this
strange girl; although I must say that of all the persons I had
seen in that world renewed, she was the most unfamiliar to me,
the most unlike what I could have thought of.&nbsp; Clara, for
instance, beautiful and bright as she was, was not unlike a
<i>very</i> pleasant and unaffected young lady; and the other
girls also seemed nothing more than specimens of very much
improved types which I had known in other times.&nbsp; But this
girl was not only beautiful with a beauty quite different from
that of &ldquo;a young lady,&rdquo; but was in all ways so
strangely interesting; so that I kept wondering what she would
say or do next to surprise and please me.&nbsp; Not, indeed, that
there was anything startling in what she actually said or did;
but it was all done in a new way, and always with that
indefinable interest and pleasure of life, which I had noticed
more or less in everybody, but which in her was more marked and
more charming than in anyone else that I had seen.</p>
<p>We were soon under way and going at a fair pace through the
beautiful reaches of the river, between Bensington and
Dorchester.&nbsp; It was now about the middle of the afternoon,
warm rather than hot, and quite windless; the clouds high up and
light, pearly white, and gleaming, softened the sun&rsquo;s
burning, but did not hide the pale blue in most places, though
they seemed to give it height and consistency; the sky, in short,
looked really like a vault, as poets have sometimes called it,
and not like mere limitless air, but a vault so vast and full of
light that it did not in any way oppress the spirits.&nbsp; It
was the sort of afternoon that Tennyson must have been thinking
about, when he said of the Lotos-Eaters&rsquo; land that it was a
land where it was always afternoon.</p>
<p>Ellen leaned back in the stern and seemed to enjoy herself
thoroughly.&nbsp; I could see that she was really looking at
things and let nothing escape her, and as I watched her, an
uncomfortable feeling that she had been a little touched by love
of the deft, ready, and handsome Dick, and that she had been
constrained to follow us because of it, faded out of my mind;
since if it had been so, she surely could not have been so
excitedly pleased, even with the beautiful scenes we were passing
through.&nbsp; For some time she did not say much, but at last,
as we had passed under Shillingford Bridge (new built, but
somewhat on its old lines), she bade me hold the boat while she
had a good look at the landscape through the graceful arch.&nbsp;
Then she turned about to me and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know whether to be sorry or glad that this is
the first time that I have been in these reaches.&nbsp; It is
true that it is a great pleasure to see all this for the first
time; but if I had had a year or two of memory of it, how sweetly
it would all have mingled with my life, waking or dreaming!&nbsp;
I am so glad Dick has been pulling slowly, so as to linger out
the time here.&nbsp; How do you feel about your first visit to
these waters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not suppose she meant a trap for me, but anyhow I fell
into it, and said: &ldquo;My first visit!&nbsp; It is not my
first visit by many a time.&nbsp; I know these reaches well;
indeed, I may say that I know every yard of the Thames from
Hammersmith to Cricklade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw the complications that might follow, as her eyes fixed
mine with a curious look in them, that I had seen before at
Runnymede, when I had said something which made it difficult for
others to understand my present position amongst these
people.&nbsp; I reddened, and said, in order to cover my mistake:
&ldquo;I wonder you have never been up so high as this, since you
live on the Thames, and moreover row so well that it would be no
great labour to you.&nbsp; Let alone,&rdquo; quoth I,
insinuatingly, &ldquo;that anybody would be glad to row
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, clearly not at my compliment (as I am sure she
need not have done, since it was a very commonplace fact), but at
something which was stirring in her mind; and she still looked at
me kindly, but with the above-said keen look in her eyes, and
then she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps it is strange, though I have a good deal
to do at home, what with looking after my father, and dealing
with two or three young men who have taken a special liking to
me, and all of whom I cannot please at once.&nbsp; But you, dear
neighbour; it seems to me stranger that you should know the upper
river, than that I should not know it; for, as I understand, you
have only been in England a few days.&nbsp; But perhaps you mean
that you have read about it in books, and seen pictures of
it?&mdash;though that does not come to much, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides, I have not
read any books about the Thames: it was one of the minor
stupidities of our time that no one thought fit to write a decent
book about what may fairly be called our only English
river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were no sooner out of my mouth than I saw that I had
made another mistake; and I felt really annoyed with myself, as I
did not want to go into a long explanation just then, or begin
another series of Odyssean lies.&nbsp; Somehow, Ellen seemed to
see this, and she took no advantage of my slip; her piercing look
changed into one of mere frank kindness, and she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow I am glad that I am travelling these
waters with you, since you know our river so well, and I know
little of it past Pangbourne, for you can tell me all I want to
know about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; She paused a minute, and then said:
&ldquo;Yet you must understand that the part I do know, I know as
thoroughly as you do.&nbsp; I should be sorry for you to think
that I am careless of a thing so beautiful and interesting as the
Thames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said this quite earnestly, and with an air of affectionate
appeal to me which pleased me very much; but I could see that she
was only keeping her doubts about me for another time.</p>
<p>Presently we came to Day&rsquo;s Lock, where Dick and his two
sitters had waited for us.&nbsp; He would have me go ashore, as
if to show me something which I had never seen before; and
nothing loth I followed him, Ellen by my side, to the
well-remembered Dykes, and the long church beyond them, which was
still used for various purposes by the good folk of Dorchester:
where, by the way, the village guest-house still had the sign of
the Fleur-de-luce which it used to bear in the days when
hospitality had to be bought and sold.&nbsp; This time, however,
I made no sign of all this being familiar to me: though as we sat
for a while on the mound of the Dykes looking up at Sinodun and
its clear-cut trench, and its sister <i>mamelon</i> of
Whittenham, I felt somewhat uncomfortable under Ellen&rsquo;s
serious attentive look, which almost drew from me the cry,
&ldquo;How little anything is changed here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stopped again at Abingdon, which, like Wallingford, was in
a way both old and new to me, since it had been lifted out of its
nineteenth-century degradation, and otherwise was as little
altered as might be.</p>
<p>Sunset was in the sky as we skirted Oxford by Oseney; we
stopped a minute or two hard by the ancient castle to put Henry
Morsom ashore.&nbsp; It was a matter of course that so far as
they could be seen from the river, I missed none of the towers
and spires of that once don-beridden city; but the meadows all
round, which, when I had last passed through them, were getting
daily more and more squalid, more and more impressed with the
seal of the &ldquo;stir and intellectual life of the nineteenth
century,&rdquo; were no longer intellectual, but had once again
become as beautiful as they should be, and the little hill of
Hinksey, with two or three very pretty stone houses new-grown on
it (I use the word advisedly; for they seemed to belong to it)
looked down happily on the full streams and waving grass, grey
now, but for the sunset, with its fast-ripening seeds.</p>
<p>The railway having disappeared, and therewith the various
level bridges over the streams of Thames, we were soon through
Medley Lock and in the wide water that washes Port Meadow, with
its numerous population of geese nowise diminished; and I thought
with interest how its name and use had survived from the older
imperfect communal period, through the time of the confused
struggle and tyranny of the rights of property, into the present
rest and happiness of complete Communism.</p>
<p>I was taken ashore again at Godstow, to see the remains of the
old nunnery, pretty nearly in the same condition as I had
remembered them; and from the high bridge over the cut close by,
I could see, even in the twilight, how beautiful the little
village with its grey stone houses had become; for we had now
come into the stone-country, in which every house must be either
built, walls and roof, of grey stone or be a blot on the
landscape.</p>
<p>We still rowed on after this, Ellen taking the sculls in my
boat; we passed a weir a little higher up, and about three miles
beyond it came by moonlight again to a little town, where we
slept at a house thinly inhabited, as its folk were mostly tented
in the hay-fields.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII: THE LITTLE RIVER</h2>
<p>We started before six o&rsquo;clock the next morning, as we
were still twenty-five miles from our resting place, and Dick
wanted to be there before dusk.&nbsp; The journey was pleasant,
though to those who do not know the upper Thames, there is little
to say about it.&nbsp; Ellen and I were once more together in her
boat, though Dick, for fairness&rsquo; sake, was for having me in
his, and letting the two women scull the green toy.&nbsp; Ellen,
however, would not allow this, but claimed me as the interesting
person of the company.&nbsp; &ldquo;After having come so
far,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will not be put off with a
companion who will be always thinking of somebody else than me:
the guest is the only person who can amuse me properly.&nbsp; I
mean that really,&rdquo; said she, turning to me, &ldquo;and have
not said it merely as a pretty saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara blushed and looked very happy at all this; for I think
up to this time she had been rather frightened of Ellen.&nbsp; As
for me I felt young again, and strange hopes of my youth were
mingling with the pleasure of the present; almost destroying it,
and quickening it into something like pain.</p>
<p>As we passed through the short and winding reaches of the now
quickly lessening stream, Ellen said: &ldquo;How pleasant this
little river is to me, who am used to a great wide wash of water;
it almost seems as if we shall have to stop at every
reach-end.&nbsp; I expect before I get home this evening I shall
have realised what a little country England is, since we can so
soon get to the end of its biggest river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not big,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but it is
pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t you find
it difficult to imagine the times when this little pretty country
was treated by its folk as if it had been an ugly characterless
waste, with no delicate beauty to be guarded, with no heed taken
of the ever fresh pleasure of the recurring seasons, and
changeful weather, and diverse quality of the soil, and so
forth?&nbsp; How could people be so cruel to
themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to each other,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; Then a sudden
resolution took hold of me, and I said: &ldquo;Dear neighbour, I
may as well tell you at once that I find it easier to imagine all
that ugly past than you do, because I myself have been part of
it.&nbsp; I see both that you have divined something of this in
me; and also I think you will believe me when I tell you of it,
so that I am going to hide nothing from you at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent a little, and then she said: &ldquo;My friend,
you have guessed right about me; and to tell you the truth I have
followed you up from Runnymede in order that I might ask you many
questions, and because I saw that you were not one of us; and
that interested and pleased me, and I wanted to make you as happy
as you could be.&nbsp; To say the truth, there was a risk in
it,&rdquo; said she, blushing&mdash;&ldquo;I mean as to Dick and
Clara; for I must tell you, since we are going to be such close
friends, that even amongst us, where there are so many beautiful
women, I have often troubled men&rsquo;s minds
disastrously.&nbsp; That is one reason why I was living alone
with my father in the cottage at Runnymede.&nbsp; But it did not
answer on that score; for of course people came there, as the
place is not a desert, and they seemed to find me all the more
interesting for living alone like that, and fell to making
stories of me to themselves&mdash;like I know you did, my
friend.&nbsp; Well, let that pass.&nbsp; This evening, or
to-morrow morning, I shall make a proposal to you to do something
which would please me very much, and I think would not hurt
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I broke in eagerly, saying that I would do anything in the
world for her; for indeed, in spite of my years and the too
obvious signs of them (though that feeling of renewed youth was
not a mere passing sensation, I think)&mdash;in spite of my
years, I say, I felt altogether too happy in the company of this
delightful girl, and was prepared to take her confidences for
more than they meant perhaps.</p>
<p>She laughed now, but looked very kindly on me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;meantime for the present we
will let it be; for I must look at this new country that we are
passing through.&nbsp; See how the river has changed character
again: it is broad now, and the reaches are long and very
slow-running.&nbsp; And look, there is a ferry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her the name of it, as I slowed off to put the
ferry-chain over our heads; and on we went passing by a bank clad
with oak trees on our left hand, till the stream narrowed again
and deepened, and we rowed on between walls of tall reeds, whose
population of reed sparrows and warblers were delightfully
restless, twittering and chuckling as the wash of the boats
stirred the reeds from the water upwards in the still, hot
morning.</p>
<p>She smiled with pleasure, and her lazy enjoyment of the new
scene seemed to bring out her beauty doubly as she leaned back
amidst the cushions, though she was far from languid; her
idleness being the idleness of a person, strong and well-knit
both in body and mind, deliberately resting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she said, springing up suddenly from her
place without any obvious effort, and balancing herself with
exquisite grace and ease; &ldquo;look at the beautiful old bridge
ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need scarcely look at that,&rdquo; said I, not
turning my head away from her beauty.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know what it
is; though&rdquo; (with a smile) &ldquo;we used not to call it
the Old Bridge time agone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked down upon me kindly, and said, &ldquo;How well we
get on now you are no longer on your guard against me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she stood looking thoughtfully at me still, till she had
to sit down as we passed under the middle one of the row of
little pointed arches of the oldest bridge across the Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O the beautiful fields!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I had
no idea of the charm of a very small river like this.&nbsp; The
smallness of the scale of everything, the short reaches, and the
speedy change of the banks, give one a feeling of going
somewhere, of coming to something strange, a feeling of adventure
which I have not felt in bigger waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked up at her delightedly; for her voice, saying the very
thing which I was thinking, was like a caress to me.&nbsp; She
caught my eye and her cheeks reddened under their tan, and she
said simply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must tell you, my friend, that when my father leaves
the Thames this summer he will take me away to a place near the
Roman wall in Cumberland; so that this voyage of mine is farewell
to the south; of course with my goodwill in a way; and yet I am
sorry for it.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to tell Dick
yesterday that we were as good as gone from the Thames-side; but
somehow to you I must needs tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped and seemed very thoughtful for awhile, and then
said smiling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say that I don&rsquo;t like moving about from
one home to another; one gets so pleasantly used to all the
detail of the life about one; it fits so harmoniously and happily
into one&rsquo;s own life, that beginning again, even in a small
way, is a kind of pain.&nbsp; But I daresay in the country which
you come from, you would think this petty and unadventurous, and
would think the worse of me for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled at me caressingly as she spoke, and I made haste to
answer: &ldquo;O, no, indeed; again you echo my very
thoughts.&nbsp; But I hardly expected to hear you speak so.&nbsp;
I gathered from all I have heard that there was a great deal of
changing of abode amongst you in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;of course people are free
to move about; but except for pleasure-parties, especially in
harvest and hay-time, like this of ours, I don&rsquo;t think they
do so much.&nbsp; I admit that I also have other moods than that
of stay-at-home, as I hinted just now, and I should like to go
with you all through the west country&mdash;thinking of
nothing,&rdquo; concluded she smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have plenty to think of,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX: A RESTING-PLACE ON THE UPPER THAMES</h2>
<p>Presently at a place where the river flowed round a headland
of the meadows, we stopped a while for rest and victuals, and
settled ourselves on a beautiful bank which almost reached the
dignity of a hill-side: the wide meadows spread before us, and
already the scythe was busy amidst the hay.&nbsp; One change I
noticed amidst the quiet beauty of the fields&mdash;to wit, that
they were planted with trees here and there, often fruit-trees,
and that there was none of the niggardly begrudging of space to a
handsome tree which I remembered too well; and though the willows
were often polled (or shrowded, as they call it in that
country-side), this was done with some regard to beauty: I mean
that there was no polling of rows on rows so as to destroy the
pleasantness of half a mile of country, but a thoughtful sequence
in the cutting, that prevented a sudden bareness anywhere.&nbsp;
To be short, the fields were everywhere treated as a garden made
for the pleasure as well as the livelihood of all, as old Hammond
told me was the case.</p>
<p>On this bank or bent of the hill, then, we had our mid-day
meal; somewhat early for dinner, if that mattered, but we had
been stirring early: the slender stream of the Thames winding
below us between the garden of a country I have been telling of;
a furlong from us was a beautiful little islet begrown with
graceful trees; on the slopes westward of us was a wood of varied
growth overhanging the narrow meadow on the south side of the
river; while to the north was a wide stretch of mead rising very
gradually from the river&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; A delicate spire of
an ancient building rose up from out of the trees in the middle
distance, with a few grey houses clustered about it; while nearer
to us, in fact not half a furlong from the water, was a quite
modern stone house&mdash;a wide quadrangle of one story, the
buildings that made it being quite low.&nbsp; There was no garden
between it and the river, nothing but a row of pear-trees still
quite young and slender; and though there did not seem to be much
ornament about it, it had a sort of natural elegance, like that
of the trees themselves.</p>
<p>As we sat looking down on all this in the sweet June day,
rather happy than merry, Ellen, who sat next me, her hand clasped
about one knee, leaned sideways to me, and said in a low voice
which Dick and Clara might have noted if they had not been busy
in happy wordless love-making: &ldquo;Friend, in your country
were the houses of your field-labourers anything like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;Well, at any rate the houses of our rich men
were not; they were mere blots upon the face of the
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find that hard to understand,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can see why the workmen, who were so oppressed, should
not have been able to live in beautiful houses; for it takes time
and leisure, and minds not over-burdened with care, to make
beautiful dwellings; and I quite understand that these poor
people were not allowed to live in such a way as to have these
(to us) necessary good things.&nbsp; But why the rich men, who
had the time and the leisure and the materials for building, as
it would be in this case, should not have housed themselves well,
I do not understand as yet.&nbsp; I know what you are meaning to
say to me,&rdquo; she said, looking me full in the eyes and
blushing, &ldquo;to wit that their houses and all belonging to
them were generally ugly and base, unless they chanced to be
ancient like yonder remnant of our forefathers&rsquo; work&rdquo;
(pointing to the spire); &ldquo;that they were&mdash;let me see;
what is the word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vulgar,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;We used to
say,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the ugliness and vulgarity of the
rich men&rsquo;s dwellings was a necessary reflection from the
sordidness and bareness of life which they forced upon the poor
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knit her brows as in thought; then turned a brightened
face on me, as if she had caught the idea, and said: &ldquo;Yes,
friend, I see what you mean.&nbsp; We have sometimes&mdash;those
of us who look into these things&mdash;talked this very matter
over; because, to say the truth, we have plenty of record of the
so-called arts of the time before Equality of Life; and there are
not wanting people who say that the state of that society was not
the cause of all that ugliness; that they were ugly in their life
because they liked to be, and could have had beautiful things
about them if they had chosen; just as a man or body of men now
may, if they please, make things more or less
beautiful&mdash;Stop!&nbsp; I know what you are going to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; said I, smiling, yet with a beating
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you are answering me,
teaching me, in some way or another, although you have not spoken
the words aloud.&nbsp; You were going to say that in times of
inequality it was an essential condition of the life of these
rich men that they should not themselves make what they wanted
for the adornment of their lives, but should force those to make
them whom they forced to live pinched and sordid lives; and that
as a necessary consequence the sordidness and pinching, the ugly
barrenness of those ruined lives, were worked up into the
adornment of the lives of the rich, and art died out amongst
men?&nbsp; Was that what you would say, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; I said, looking at her eagerly; for
she had risen and was standing on the edge of the bent, the light
wind stirring her dainty raiment, one hand laid on her bosom, the
other arm stretched downward and clenched in her earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is true!&nbsp;
We have proved it true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think amidst my&mdash;something more than interest in her,
and admiration for her, I was beginning to wonder how it would
all end.&nbsp; I had a glimmering of fear of what might follow;
of anxiety as to the remedy which this new age might offer for
the missing of something one might set one&rsquo;s heart
on.&nbsp; But now Dick rose to his feet and cried out in his
hearty manner: &ldquo;Neighbour Ellen, are you quarrelling with
the guest, or are you worrying him to tell you things which he
cannot properly explain to our ignorance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, dear neighbour,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was so far from quarrelling with him that I think I have
been making him good friends both with himself and me.&nbsp; Is
it so, dear guest?&rdquo; she said, looking down at me with a
delightful smile of confidence in being understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, moreover,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I must say for
him that he has explained himself to me very well indeed, so that
I quite understand him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; quoth Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I first
set eyes on you at Runnymede I knew that there was something
wonderful in your keenness of wits.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say that
as a mere pretty speech to please you,&rdquo; said he quickly,
&ldquo;but because it is true; and it made me want to see more of
you.&nbsp; But, come, we ought to be going; for we are not half
way, and we ought to be in well before sunset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And therewith he took Clara&rsquo;s hand, and led her down the
bent.&nbsp; But Ellen stood thoughtfully looking down for a
little, and as I took her hand to follow Dick, she turned round
to me and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might tell me a great deal and make many things
clear to me, if you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am pretty well fit for
that,&mdash;and for nothing else&mdash;an old man like
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not notice the bitterness which, whether I liked it or
not, was in my voice as I spoke, but went on: &ldquo;It is not so
much for myself; I should be quite content to dream about past
times, and if I could not idealise them, yet at least idealise
some of the people who lived in them.&nbsp; But I think sometimes
people are too careless of the history of the past&mdash;too apt
to leave it in the hands of old learned men like Hammond.&nbsp;
Who knows?&nbsp; Happy as we are, times may alter; we may be
bitten with some impulse towards change, and many things may seem
too wonderful for us to resist, too exciting not to catch at, if
we do not know that they are but phases of what has been before;
and withal ruinous, deceitful, and sordid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we went slowly down toward the boats she said again:
&ldquo;Not for myself alone, dear friend; I shall have children;
perhaps before the end a good many;&mdash;I hope so.&nbsp; And
though of course I cannot force any special kind of knowledge
upon them, yet, my Friend, I cannot help thinking that just as
they might be like me in body, so I might impress upon them some
part of my ways of thinking; that is, indeed, some of the
essential part of myself; that part which was not mere moods,
created by the matters and events round about me.&nbsp; What do
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of one thing I was sure, that her beauty and kindness and
eagerness combined, forced me to think as she did, when she was
not earnestly laying herself open to receive my thoughts.&nbsp; I
said, what at the time was true, that I thought it most
important; and presently stood entranced by the wonder of her
grace as she stepped into the light boat, and held out her hand
to me.&nbsp; And so on we went up the Thames still&mdash;or
whither?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX: THE JOURNEY&rsquo;S END</h2>
<p>On we went.&nbsp; In spite of my new-born excitement about
Ellen, and my gathering fear of where it would land me, I could
not help taking abundant interest in the condition of the river
and its banks; all the more as she never seemed weary of the
changing picture, but looked at every yard of flowery bank and
gurgling eddy with the same kind of affectionate interest which I
myself once had so fully, as I used to think, and perhaps had not
altogether lost even in this strangely changed society with all
its wonders.&nbsp; Ellen seemed delighted with my pleasure at
this, that, or the other piece of carefulness in dealing with the
river: the nursing of pretty corners; the ingenuity in dealing
with difficulties of water-engineering, so that the most
obviously useful works looked beautiful and natural also.&nbsp;
All this, I say, pleased me hugely, and she was pleased at my
pleasure&mdash;but rather puzzled too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem astonished,&rdquo; she said, just after we had
passed a mill <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a> which spanned all the stream save the
water-way for traffic, but which was as beautiful in its way as a
Gothic cathedral&mdash;&ldquo;You seem astonished at this being
so pleasant to look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;in a way I am; though I
don&rsquo;t see why it should not be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, looking at me admiringly, yet with
a lurking smile in her face, &ldquo;you know all about the
history of the past.&nbsp; Were they not always careful about
this little stream which now adds so much pleasantness to the
country side?&nbsp; It would always be easy to manage this little
river.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; I forgot, though,&rdquo; she said, as her
eye caught mine, &ldquo;in the days we are thinking of pleasure
was wholly neglected in such matters.&nbsp; But how did they
manage the river in the days that you&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Lived
in she was going to say; but correcting herself,
said&mdash;&ldquo;in the days of which you have
record?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <i>mis</i>managed it,&rdquo; quoth I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Up to the first half of the nineteenth century, when it
was still more or less of a highway for the country people, some
care was taken of the river and its banks; and though I
don&rsquo;t suppose anyone troubled himself about its aspect, yet
it was trim and beautiful.&nbsp; But when the railways&mdash;of
which no doubt you have heard&mdash;came into power, they would
not allow the people of the country to use either the natural or
artificial waterways, of which latter there were a great
many.&nbsp; I suppose when we get higher up we shall see one of
these; a very important one, which one of these railways entirely
closed to the public, so that they might force people to send
their goods by their private road, and so tax them as heavily as
they could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen laughed heartily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;that is not stated clearly enough in our history-books,
and it is worth knowing.&nbsp; But certainly the people of those
days must have been a curiously lazy set.&nbsp; We are not either
fidgety or quarrelsome now, but if any one tried such a piece of
folly on us, we should use the said waterways, whoever gainsaid
us: surely that would be simple enough.&nbsp; However, I remember
other cases of this stupidity: when I was on the Rhine two years
ago, I remember they showed us ruins of old castles, which,
according to what we heard, must have been made for pretty much
the same purpose as the railways were.&nbsp; But I am
interrupting your history of the river: pray go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is both short and stupid enough,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;The river having lost its practical or commercial
value&mdash;that is, being of no use to make money
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I understand what that queer phrase
means,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was utterly neglected, till at last it became
a nuisance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; quoth Ellen, &ldquo;I understand: like the
railways and the robber knights.&nbsp; Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So then they turned the makeshift business on to it,
and handed it over to a body up in London, who from time to time,
in order to show that they had something to do, did some damage
here and there,&mdash;cut down trees, destroying the banks
thereby; dredged the river (where it was not needed always), and
threw the dredgings on the fields so as to spoil them; and so
forth.&nbsp; But for the most part they practised &lsquo;masterly
inactivity,&rsquo; as it was then called&mdash;that is, they drew
their salaries, and let things alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew their salaries,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know that means that they were allowed to take an extra lot of
other people&rsquo;s goods for doing nothing.&nbsp; And if that
had been all, it really might have been worth while to let them
do so, if you couldn&rsquo;t find any other way of keeping them
quiet; but it seems to me that being so paid, they could not help
doing something, and that something was bound to be
mischief,&mdash;because,&rdquo; said she, kindling with sudden
anger, &ldquo;the whole business was founded on lies and false
pretensions.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean only these river-guardians,
but all these master-people I have read of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how happy you are to have
got out of the parsimony of oppression!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you sigh?&rdquo; she said, kindly and somewhat
anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;You seem to think that it will not
last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will last for you,&rdquo; quoth I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not for you?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely it is for all the world; and if your country is
somewhat backward, it will come into line before long.&nbsp;
Or,&rdquo; she said quickly, &ldquo;are you thinking that you
must soon go back again?&nbsp; I will make my proposal which I
told you of at once, and so perhaps put an end to your
anxiety.&nbsp; I was going to propose that you should live with
us where we are going.&nbsp; I feel quite old friends with you,
and should be sorry to lose you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she smiled on
me, and said: &ldquo;Do you know, I begin to suspect you of
wanting to nurse a sham sorrow, like the ridiculous characters in
some of those queer old novels that I have come across now and
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I really had almost begun to suspect it myself, but I refused
to admit so much; so I sighed no more, but fell to giving my
delightful companion what little pieces of history I knew about
the river and its borderlands; and the time passed pleasantly
enough; and between the two of us (she was a better sculler than
I was, and seemed quite tireless) we kept up fairly well with
Dick, hot as the afternoon was, and swallowed up the way at a
great rate.&nbsp; At last we passed under another ancient bridge;
and through meadows bordered at first with huge elm-trees mingled
with sweet chestnut of younger but very elegant growth; and the
meadows widened out so much that it seemed as if the trees must
now be on the bents only, or about the houses, except for the
growth of willows on the immediate banks; so that the wide
stretch of grass was little broken here.&nbsp; Dick got very much
excited now, and often stood up in the boat to cry out to us that
this was such and such a field, and so forth; and we caught fire
at his enthusiasm for the hay-field and its harvest, and pulled
our best.</p>
<p>At last as we were passing through a reach of the river where
on the side of the towing-path was a highish bank with a thick
whispering bed of reeds before it, and on the other side a higher
bank, clothed with willows that dipped into the stream and
crowned by ancient elm-trees, we saw bright figures coming along
close to the bank, as if they were looking for something; as,
indeed, they were, and we&mdash;that is, Dick and his
company&mdash;were what they were looking for.&nbsp; Dick lay on
his oars, and we followed his example.&nbsp; He gave a joyous
shout to the people on the bank, which was echoed back from it in
many voices, deep and sweetly shrill; for there were above a
dozen persons, both men, women, and children.&nbsp; A tall
handsome woman, with black wavy hair and deep-set grey eyes, came
forward on the bank and waved her hand gracefully to us, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, my friend, we have almost had to wait for
you!&nbsp; What excuse have you to make for your slavish
punctuality?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you take us by surprise, and
come yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said Dick, with an almost imperceptible jerk
of his head toward our boat, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t want to come
too quick up the water; there is so much to see for those who
have not been up here before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; said the stately lady, for stately
is the word that must be used for her; &ldquo;and we want them to
get to know the wet way from the east thoroughly well, since they
must often use it now.&nbsp; But come ashore at once, Dick, and
you, dear neighbours; there is a break in the reeds and a good
landing-place just round the corner.&nbsp; We can carry up your
things, or send some of the lads after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;it is easier going by
water, though it is but a step.&nbsp; Besides, I want to bring my
friend here to the proper place.&nbsp; We will go on to the Ford;
and you can talk to us from the bank as we paddle
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled his sculls through the water, and on we went,
turning a sharp angle and going north a little.&nbsp; Presently
we saw before us a bank of elm-trees, which told us of a house
amidst them, though I looked in vain for the grey walls that I
expected to see there.&nbsp; As we went, the folk on the bank
talked indeed, mingling their kind voices with the cuckoo&rsquo;s
song, the sweet strong whistle of the blackbirds, and the
ceaseless note of the corn-crake as he crept through the long
grass of the mowing-field; whence came waves of fragrance from
the flowering clover amidst of the ripe grass.</p>
<p>In a few minutes we had passed through a deep eddying pool
into the sharp stream that ran from the ford, and beached our
craft on a tiny strand of limestone-gravel, and stepped ashore
into the arms of our up-river friends, our journey done.</p>
<p>I disentangled myself from the merry throng, and mounting on
the cart-road that ran along the river some feet above the water,
I looked round about me.&nbsp; The river came down through a wide
meadow on my left, which was grey now with the ripened seeding
grasses; the gleaming water was lost presently by a turn of the
bank, but over the meadow I could see the mingled gables of a
building where I knew the lock must be, and which now seemed to
combine a mill with it.&nbsp; A low wooded ridge bounded the
river-plain to the south and south-east, whence we had come, and
a few low houses lay about its feet and up its slope.&nbsp; I
turned a little to my right, and through the hawthorn sprays and
long shoots of the wild roses could see the flat country
spreading out far away under the sun of the calm evening, till
something that might be called hills with a look of
sheep-pastures about them bounded it with a soft blue line.&nbsp;
Before me, the elm-boughs still hid most of what houses there
might be in this river-side dwelling of men; but to the right of
the cart-road a few grey buildings of the simplest kind showed
here and there.</p>
<p>There I stood in a dreamy mood, and rubbed my eyes as if I
were not wholly awake, and half expected to see the gay-clad
company of beautiful men and women change to two or three
spindle-legged back-bowed men and haggard, hollow-eyed,
ill-favoured women, who once wore down the soil of this land with
their heavy hopeless feet, from day to day, and season to season,
and year to year.&nbsp; But no change came as yet, and my heart
swelled with joy as I thought of all the beautiful grey villages,
from the river to the plain and the plain to the uplands, which I
could picture to myself so well, all peopled now with this happy
and lovely folk, who had cast away riches and attained to
wealth.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI: AN OLD HOUSE AMONGST NEW FOLK</h2>
<p>As I stood there Ellen detached herself from our happy friends
who still stood on the little strand and came up to me.&nbsp; She
took me by the hand, and said softly, &ldquo;Take me on to the
house at once; we need not wait for the others: I had rather
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a mind to say that I did not know the way thither, and
that the river-side dwellers should lead; but almost without my
will my feet moved on along the road they knew.&nbsp; The raised
way led us into a little field bounded by a backwater of the
river on one side; on the right hand we could see a cluster of
small houses and barns, new and old, and before us a grey stone
barn and a wall partly overgrown with ivy, over which a few grey
gables showed.&nbsp; The village road ended in the shallow of the
aforesaid backwater.&nbsp; We crossed the road, and again almost
without my will my hand raised the latch of a door in the wall,
and we stood presently on a stone path which led up to the old
house to which fate in the shape of Dick had so strangely brought
me in this new world of men.&nbsp; My companion gave a sigh of
pleased surprise and enjoyment; nor did I wonder, for the garden
between the wall and the house was redolent of the June flowers,
and the roses were rolling over one another with that delicious
superabundance of small well-tended gardens which at first sight
takes away all thought from the beholder save that of
beauty.&nbsp; The blackbirds were singing their loudest, the
doves were cooing on the roof-ridge, the rooks in the high
elm-trees beyond were garrulous among the young leaves, and the
swifts wheeled whining about the gables.&nbsp; And the house
itself was a fit guardian for all the beauty of this heart of
summer.</p>
<p>Once again Ellen echoed my thoughts as she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, friend, this is what I came out for to see; this
many-gabled old house built by the simple country-folk of the
long-past times, regardless of all the turmoil that was going on
in cities and courts, is lovely still amidst all the beauty which
these latter days have created; and I do not wonder at our
friends tending it carefully and making much of it.&nbsp; It
seems to me as if it had waited for these happy days, and held in
it the gathered crumbs of happiness of the confused and turbulent
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led me up close to the house, and laid her shapely
sun-browned hand and arm on the lichened wall as if to embrace
it, and cried out, &ldquo;O me!&nbsp; O me!&nbsp; How I love the
earth, and the seasons, and weather, and all things that deal
with it, and all that grows out of it,&mdash;as this has
done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not answer her, or say a word.&nbsp; Her exultation
and pleasure were so keen and exquisite, and her beauty, so
delicate, yet so interfused with energy, expressed it so fully,
that any added word would have been commonplace and futile.&nbsp;
I dreaded lest the others should come in suddenly and break the
spell she had cast about me; but we stood there a while by the
corner of the big gable of the house, and no one came.&nbsp; I
heard the merry voices some way off presently, and knew that they
were going along the river to the great meadow on the other side
of the house and garden.</p>
<p>We drew back a little, and looked up at the house: the door
and the windows were open to the fragrant sun-cured air; from the
upper window-sills hung festoons of flowers in honour of the
festival, as if the others shared in the love for the old
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Ellen.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope nothing
will spoil it inside; but I don&rsquo;t think it will.&nbsp;
Come! we must go back presently to the others.&nbsp; They have
gone on to the tents; for surely they must have tents pitched for
the haymakers&mdash;the house would not hold a tithe of the folk,
I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led me on to the door, murmuring little above her breath
as she did so, &ldquo;The earth and the growth of it and the life
of it!&nbsp; If I could but say or show how I love it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went in, and found no soul in any room as we wandered from
room to room,&mdash;from the rose-covered porch to the strange
and quaint garrets amongst the great timbers of the roof, where
of old time the tillers and herdsmen of the manor slept, but
which a-nights seemed now, by the small size of the beds, and the
litter of useless and disregarded matters&mdash;bunches of dying
flowers, feathers of birds, shells of starling&rsquo;s eggs,
caddis worms in mugs, and the like&mdash;seemed to be inhabited
for the time by children.</p>
<p>Everywhere there was but little furniture, and that only the
most necessary, and of the simplest forms.&nbsp; The extravagant
love of ornament which I had noted in this people elsewhere
seemed here to have given place to the feeling that the house
itself and its associations was the ornament of the country life
amidst which it had been left stranded from old times, and that
to re-ornament it would but take away its use as a piece of
natural beauty.</p>
<p>We sat down at last in a room over the wall which Ellen had
caressed, and which was still hung with old tapestry, originally
of no artistic value, but now faded into pleasant grey tones
which harmonised thoroughly well with the quiet of the place, and
which would have been ill supplanted by brighter and more
striking decoration.</p>
<p>I asked a few random questions of Ellen as we sat there, but
scarcely listened to her answers, and presently became silent,
and then scarce conscious of anything, but that I was there in
that old room, the doves crooning from the roofs of the barn and
dovecot beyond the window opposite to me.</p>
<p>My thought returned to me after what I think was but a minute
or two, but which, as in a vivid dream, seemed as if it had
lasted a long time, when I saw Ellen sitting, looking all the
fuller of life and pleasure and desire from the contrast with the
grey faded tapestry with its futile design, which was now only
bearable because it had grown so faint and feeble.</p>
<p>She looked at me kindly, but as if she read me through and
through.&nbsp; She said: &ldquo;You have begun again your
never-ending contrast between the past and this present.&nbsp; Is
it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was thinking of
what you, with your capacity and intelligence, joined to your
love of pleasure, and your impatience of unreasonable
restraint&mdash;of what you would have been in that past.&nbsp;
And even now, when all is won and has been for a long time, my
heart is sickened with thinking of all the waste of life that has
gone on for so many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So many centuries,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so many
ages!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;too true,&rdquo; and sat
silent again.</p>
<p>She rose up and said: &ldquo;Come, I must not let you go off
into a dream again so soon.&nbsp; If we must lose you, I want you
to see all that you can see first before you go back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lose me?&rdquo; I said&mdash;&ldquo;go back
again?&nbsp; Am I not to go up to the North with you?&nbsp; What
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled somewhat sadly, and said: &ldquo;Not yet; we will
not talk of that yet.&nbsp; Only, what were you thinking of just
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said falteringly: &ldquo;I was saying to myself, The past,
the present?&nbsp; Should she not have said the contrast of the
present with the future: of blind despair with hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Then she caught my
hand and said excitedly, &ldquo;Come, while there is yet
time!&nbsp; Come!&rdquo; And she led me out of the room; and as
we were going downstairs and out of the house into the garden by
a little side door which opened out of a curious lobby, she said
in a calm voice, as if she wished me to forget her sudden
nervousness: &ldquo;Come! we ought to join the others before they
come here looking for us.&nbsp; And let me tell you, my friend,
that I can see you are too apt to fall into mere dreamy musing:
no doubt because you are not yet used to our life of repose
amidst of energy; of work which is pleasure and pleasure which is
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused a little, and as we came out into the lovely garden
again, she said: &ldquo;My friend, you were saying that you
wondered what I should have been if I had lived in those past
days of turmoil and oppression.&nbsp; Well, I think I have
studied the history of them to know pretty well.&nbsp; I should
have been one of the poor, for my father when he was working was
a mere tiller of the soil.&nbsp; Well, I could not have borne
that; therefore my beauty and cleverness and brightness&rdquo;
(she spoke with no blush or simper of false shame) &ldquo;would
have been sold to rich men, and my life would have been wasted
indeed; for I know enough of that to know that I should have had
no choice, no power of will over my life; and that I should never
have bought pleasure from the rich men, or even opportunity of
action, whereby I might have won some true excitement.&nbsp; I
should have wrecked and wasted in one way or another, either by
penury or by luxury.&nbsp; Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>She was going to say something else, when a little gate in the
fence, which led into a small elm-shaded field, was opened, and
Dick came with hasty cheerfulness up the garden path, and was
presently standing between us, a hand laid on the shoulder of
each.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;Well, neighbours, I thought you two
would like to see the old house quietly without a crowd in
it.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it a jewel of a house after its kind?&nbsp;
Well, come along, for it is getting towards dinner-time.&nbsp;
Perhaps you, guest, would like a swim before we sit down to what
I fancy will be a pretty long feast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I should like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye for the present, neighbour Ellen,&rdquo;
said Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here comes Clara to take care of you, as
I fancy she is more at home amongst our friends here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara came out of the fields as he spoke; and with one look at
Ellen I turned and went with Dick, doubting, if I must say the
truth, whether I should see her again.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII: THE FEAST&rsquo;S BEGINNING&mdash;THE END</h2>
<p>Dick brought me at once into the little field which, as I had
seen from the garden, was covered with gaily-coloured tents
arranged in orderly lanes, about which were sitting and lying on
the grass some fifty or sixty men, women, and children, all of
them in the height of good temper and enjoyment&mdash;with their
holiday mood on, so to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are thinking that we don&rsquo;t make a great show
as to numbers,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;but you must remember
that we shall have more to-morrow; because in this haymaking work
there is room for a great many people who are not over-skilled in
country matters: and there are many who lead sedentary lives,
whom it would be unkind to deprive of their pleasure in the
hay-field&mdash;scientific men and close students generally: so
that the skilled workmen, outside those who are wanted as mowers,
and foremen of the haymaking, stand aside, and take a little
downright rest, which you know is good for them, whether they
like it or not: or else they go to other countrysides, as I am
doing here.&nbsp; You see, the scientific men and historians, and
students generally, will not be wanted till we are fairly in the
midst of the tedding, which of course will not be till the day
after to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that he brought me out of the
little field on to a kind of causeway above the river-side
meadow, and thence turning to the left on to a path through the
mowing grass, which was thick and very tall, led on till we came
to the river above the weir and its mill.&nbsp; There we had a
delightful swim in the broad piece of water above the lock, where
the river looked much bigger than its natural size from its being
dammed up by the weir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are in a fit mood for dinner,&rdquo; said Dick,
when we had dressed and were going through the grass again;
&ldquo;and certainly of all the cheerful meals in the year, this
one of haysel is the cheerfullest; not even excepting the
corn-harvest feast; for then the year is beginning to fail, and
one cannot help having a feeling behind all the gaiety, of the
coming of the dark days, and the shorn fields and empty gardens;
and the spring is almost too far off to look forward to.&nbsp; It
is, then, in the autumn, when one almost believes in
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strangely you talk,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of such a
constantly recurring and consequently commonplace matter as the
sequence of the seasons.&rdquo; And indeed these people were like
children about such things, and had what seemed to me a quite
exaggerated interest in the weather, a fine day, a dark night, or
a brilliant one, and the like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangely?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it strange
to sympathise with the year and its gains and losses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you look upon the
course of the year as a beautiful and interesting drama, which is
what I think you do, you should be as much pleased and interested
with the winter and its trouble and pain as with this wonderful
summer luxury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And am I not?&rdquo; said Dick, rather warmly;
&ldquo;only I can&rsquo;t look upon it as if I were sitting in a
theatre seeing the play going on before me, myself taking no part
of it.&nbsp; It is difficult,&rdquo; said he, smiling
good-humouredly, &ldquo;for a non-literary man like me to explain
myself properly, like that dear girl Ellen would; but I mean that
I am part of it all, and feel the pain as well as the pleasure in
my own person.&nbsp; It is not done for me by somebody else,
merely that I may eat and drink and sleep; but I myself do my
share of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his way also, as Ellen in hers, I could see that Dick had
that passionate love of the earth which was common to but few
people at least, in the days I knew; in which the prevailing
feeling amongst intellectual persons was a kind of sour distaste
for the changing drama of the year, for the life of earth and its
dealings with men.&nbsp; Indeed, in those days it was thought
poetic and imaginative to look upon life as a thing to be borne,
rather than enjoyed.</p>
<p>So I mused till Dick&rsquo;s laugh brought me back into the
Oxfordshire hay-fields.&nbsp; &ldquo;One thing seems strange to
me,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;that I must needs trouble myself
about the winter and its scantiness, in the midst of the summer
abundance.&nbsp; If it hadn&rsquo;t happened to me before, I
should have thought it was your doing, guest; that you had thrown
a kind of evil charm over me.&nbsp; Now, you know,&rdquo; said
he, suddenly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s only a joke, so you
mustn&rsquo;t take it to heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet I did feel somewhat uneasy at his
words, after all.</p>
<p>We crossed the causeway this time, and did not turn back to
the house, but went along a path beside a field of wheat now
almost ready to blossom.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not dine in the house or garden, then?&mdash;as
indeed I did not expect to do.&nbsp; Where do we meet,
then?&nbsp; For I can see that the houses are mostly very
small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;you are right, they are
small in this country-side: there are so many good old houses
left, that people dwell a good deal in such small detached
houses.&nbsp; As to our dinner, we are going to have our feast in
the church.&nbsp; I wish, for your sake, it were as big and
handsome as that of the old Roman town to the west, or the forest
town to the north; <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> but, however, it will hold us all; and
though it is a little thing, it is beautiful in its
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was somewhat new to me, this dinner in a church, and I
thought of the church-ales of the Middle Ages; but I said
nothing, and presently we came out into the road which ran
through the village.&nbsp; Dick looked up and down it, and seeing
only two straggling groups before us, said: &ldquo;It seems as if
we must be somewhat late; they are all gone on; and they will be
sure to make a point of waiting for you, as the guest of guests,
since you come from so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hastened as he spoke, and I kept up with him, and presently
we came to a little avenue of lime-trees which led us straight to
the church porch, from whose open door came the sound of cheerful
voices and laughter, and varied merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the coolest
place for one thing, this hot evening.&nbsp; Come along; they
will be glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, in spite of my bath, I felt the weather more sultry
and oppressive than on any day of our journey yet.</p>
<p>We went into the church, which was a simple little building
with one little aisle divided from the nave by three round
arches, a chancel, and a rather roomy transept for so small a
building, the windows mostly of the graceful Oxfordshire
fourteenth century type.&nbsp; There was no modern architectural
decoration in it; it looked, indeed, as if none had been
attempted since the Puritans whitewashed the medi&aelig;val
saints and histories on the wall.&nbsp; It was, however, gaily
dressed up for this latter-day festival, with festoons of flowers
from arch to arch, and great pitchers of flowers standing about
on the floor; while under the west window hung two cross scythes,
their blades polished white, and gleaming from out of the flowers
that wreathed them.&nbsp; But its best ornament was the crowd of
handsome, happy-looking men and women that were set down to
table, and who, with their bright faces and rich hair over their
gay holiday raiment, looked, as the Persian poet puts it, like a
bed of tulips in the sun.&nbsp; Though the church was a small
one, there was plenty of room; for a small church makes a biggish
house; and on this evening there was no need to set cross tables
along the transepts; though doubtless these would be wanted next
day, when the learned men of whom Dick has been speaking should
be come to take their more humble part in the haymaking.</p>
<p>I stood on the threshold with the expectant smile on my face
of a man who is going to take part in a festivity which he is
really prepared to enjoy.&nbsp; Dick, standing by me was looking
round the company with an air of proprietorship in them, I
thought.&nbsp; Opposite me sat Clara and Ellen, with Dick&rsquo;s
place open between them: they were smiling, but their beautiful
faces were each turned towards the neighbours on either side, who
were talking to them, and they did not seem to see me.&nbsp; I
turned to Dick, expecting him to lead me forward, and he turned
his face to me; but strange to say, though it was as smiling and
cheerful as ever, it made no response to my glance&mdash;nay, he
seemed to take no heed at all of my presence, and I noticed that
none of the company looked at me.&nbsp; A pang shot through me,
as of some disaster long expected and suddenly realised.&nbsp;
Dick moved on a little without a word to me.&nbsp; I was not
three yards from the two women who, though they had been my
companions for such a short time, had really, as I thought,
become my friends.&nbsp; Clara&rsquo;s face was turned full upon
me now, but she also did not seem to see me, though I know I was
trying to catch her eye with an appealing look.&nbsp; I turned to
Ellen, and she <i>did</i> seem to recognise me for an instant;
but her bright face turned sad directly, and she shook her head
with a mournful look, and the next moment all consciousness of my
presence had faded from her face.</p>
<p>I felt lonely and sick at heart past the power of words to
describe.&nbsp; I hung about a minute longer, and then turned and
went out of the porch again and through the lime-avenue into the
road, while the blackbirds sang their strongest from the bushes
about me in the hot June evening.</p>
<p>Once more without any conscious effort of will I set my face
toward the old house by the ford, but as I turned round the
corner which led to the remains of the village cross, I came upon
a figure strangely contrasting with the joyous, beautiful people
I had left behind in the church.&nbsp; It was a man who looked
old, but whom I knew from habit, now half forgotten, was really
not much more than fifty.&nbsp; His face was rugged, and grimed
rather than dirty; his eyes dull and bleared; his body bent, his
calves thin and spindly, his feet dragging and limping.&nbsp; His
clothing was a mixture of dirt and rags long over-familiar to
me.&nbsp; As I passed him he touched his hat with some real
goodwill and courtesy, and much servility.</p>
<p>Inexpressibly shocked, I hurried past him and hastened along
the road that led to the river and the lower end of the village;
but suddenly I saw as it were a black cloud rolling along to meet
me, like a nightmare of my childish days; and for a while I was
conscious of nothing else than being in the dark, and whether I
was walking, or sitting, or lying down, I could not tell.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; * *</p>
<p>I lay in my bed in my house at dingy Hammersmith thinking
about it all; and trying to consider if I was overwhelmed with
despair at finding I had been dreaming a dream; and strange to
say, I found that I was not so despairing.</p>
<p>Or indeed <i>was</i> it a dream?&nbsp; If so, why was I so
conscious all along that I was really seeing all that new life
from the outside, still wrapped up in the prejudices, the
anxieties, the distrust of this time of doubt and struggle?</p>
<p>All along, though those friends were so real to me, I had been
feeling as if I had no business amongst them: as though the time
would come when they would reject me, and say, as Ellen&rsquo;s
last mournful look seemed to say, &ldquo;No, it will not do; you
cannot be of us; you belong so entirely to the unhappiness of the
past that our happiness even would weary you.&nbsp; Go back
again, now you have seen us, and your outward eyes have learned
that in spite of all the infallible maxims of your day there is
yet a time of rest in store for the world, when mastery has
changed into fellowship&mdash;but not before.&nbsp; Go back
again, then, and while you live you will see all round you people
engaged in making others live lives which are not their own,
while they themselves care nothing for their own real
lives&mdash;men who hate life though they fear death.&nbsp; Go
back and be the happier for having seen us, for having added a
little hope to your struggle.&nbsp; Go on living while you may,
striving, with whatsoever pain and labour needs must be, to build
up little by little the new day of fellowship, and rest, and
happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, surely! and if others can see it as I have seen it, then
it may be called a vision rather than a dream.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
